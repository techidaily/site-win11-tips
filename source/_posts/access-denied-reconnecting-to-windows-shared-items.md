## Access Denied: Reconnecting to Windows Shared Items

 Shared folders make it really quick to share files or folders on a go. You just need to set up network sharing on your computer, and you're good to go.

 However, sometimes you may encounter problems while accessing a shared folder. For example, you may face a permissions issue or see an indefinite waiting time after clicking on a shared folder.

 If you're experiencing such sharing issues, don't give up. Keep reading to learn about several fixes you can try to get your shared folder up and running again.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 The first thing you should do is make sure your internet connection is working properly. If your internet connection is too slow, you might not be able to open the shared folder.

 To check your internet connection, you can [visit a website to test your internet speed](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wifi-speed-test-mistakes/) or try to access other websites or online services. If you can't connect to the internet, you'll need to troubleshoot your internet connection before you can consider other possible solutions.

 Note that shared folders only work on a network, which means all the computers must be connected via the same local area network (LAN), such as Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable. If you're connected to a different network, shared folders will not work.

 If all your devices are on the same network, check if your Wi-Fi router is functioning properly or experiencing issues.

## 2\. Ask the Owner to Change the Permissions

 While setting up a shared folder, Windows allows you to set custom permissions, such as allowing or denying full control, read and write permissions, etc.

 If you're unable to access a shared folder that someone else owns, it's possible that you may not have permission to access the folder. So, ask the owner to modify the permissions for the folder and grant you read/write access.

 If you're the owner, follow these steps to change the permissions of a shared folder on Windows:

1. Press**Win + E** to open Windows File Explorer.
2. Right-click on the shared folder or drive that you're trying to share and click**Properties** on the context menu.  
![Shared Folder Context Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shared-folder-context-menu.jpg)
3. In the**Properties** window, click on**Sharing > Advanced Sharing** .  
![Sharing Folder Sharing Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sharing-folder-sharing-options.jpg)
4. Click**Permissions** to edit all the sharing permissions. If you have not allowed**Everyone** to access the files, make sure to click**Add...** and add the user manually.
5. Edit the permissions as needed, and then click**OK** to apply the changes.

 By giving your friend or teammate the right access permissions, they should now be able to easily access the files. However, if the problem persists, move on to some advanced troubleshooting steps.

## 3\. Restart the Networking Services

 Another possibility for shared folder-related errors is a misconfigured networking service on your computer.

 Networking services manage all the network connections and communication on your computer. You can try restarting the networking services to regain access to the shared folder.

Follow this step-by-step guide to restart the networking services:

1. Press**Win + Q** and type**Services** . Alternatively, there are many other [ways to open the Services app](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-services-app/) on Windows.  
![Services App In Windows Search](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/services-app-in-windows-search.jpg)
2. Choose**Open** to launch the Services app.
3. Find the**Function Discovery Provider Host** service and right-click on it.
4. Select**Restart** from the context menu that appears.  
![Services App On Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/services-app-on-windows.jpg)
5. Repeat the same procedure (right-click and select**Restart**) with the following services, one by one:**Network Connections** **SSDP Discovery** **TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper** **UPnP Device Host**

 These services are responsible for various networking functions on Windows. Restarting them can help resolve issues that may be causing problems with accessing shared folders.

## 4\. Turn on Network Discovery in Windows Settings

 Network discovery on Windows allows other devices on the connected network to discover your computer. If you have disabled this option by mistake, you will not be able to access any shared folders hosted on another computer.

To turn on Network discovery, follow these steps:

1. Type**Control Panel** in the Windows search bar and select the best match.
2. Click**View network status and tasks** .  
![Control Panel Overview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/control-panel-overview.jpg)
3. On the left-hand pane, click**Change advanced sharing settings** .
4. Under**Private networks** , turn**On** the**Network discovery** option.  
![Windows Advanced Sharing Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-advanced-sharing-settings.jpg)
5. Turn**On** the**File and printer sharing** option as well.

 If you want to disable login abilities for accessing the shared folder, toggle**Password protected sharing** to**Off** .

 Once you change these settings, you should have no trouble getting access to shared folders.

## 5\. Check the Windows Firewall Settings

 If you're still unable to access the shared folder, you may need to check your firewall settings. Understand a firewall as a wall between your computer and the internet or other networks that helps prevent unauthorized access to your system.

 Sometimes, a firewall may block access to the shared folder. For example, if the firewall is set to block all incoming traffic, it will prevent other computers on the network or the internet from accessing your shared folders.

Here's how you can fix all the firewall issues on your computer:

1. Open the Windows start menu and type**Firewall & network protection** .
2. Select the best match and press**Enter** .
3. Click**Public network** .  
![Windows Security App Preview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-security-preview.jpg)
4. Uncheck or disable the option saying**Block all incoming connections** .
5. Perform the same step with**Domain network** and**Private network** as well.
6. Restart your PC to make sure the firewall is not blocking any Internet connections now.

 This will allow all incoming connections, or, in other words, solve your sharing folder issue on Windows.

## 6\. Reset the Network Settings

 If none of the above solutions work, you may need to reset your network settings. Resetting the network settings will restore all the network-related settings to their factory defaults, which should allow you to connect to your network again.

 Before moving forward, we recommend [creating a restore point on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) to stay on the safe side. A restore point will help you revert any changes made to your computer.

Here's how to reset the network settings on Windows:

1. Open the Windows search bar by pressing**Win + Q** and typing**Command Prompt** .
2. Select the best match, and from the right-side menu, click**Run as administrator** .  
![CMD In Search Bar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cmd-in-search-bar.jpg)
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the**netsh int ip reset** command without the double quotes.  
![Ip Reset Command In Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ip-reset-command.jpg)
4. Press**Enter** to execute the command. This will reset your network settings.

 This command is helpful in solving many common networking issues, such as when your computer fails to connect to a network or when the internet connection is not stable. So, the next time you face a network-related error, you now have a handy command for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Shared Folders on Windows

 Hopefully, you have fixed the shared folder access problems by now. If not, it's possible there is a deeper issue with your network or the configuration of your server. In such cases, it's best to seek help from a technical support professional.

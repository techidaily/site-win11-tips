## How to Fix Voice Chat Not Working in Valorant on Windows

 Is voice chat not working in Valorant? If so, there could be several reasons causing this issue. You might have selected the wrong microphone in Valorant settings, muted it, misconfigured other voice chat settings, and more. As such, it can be hard to pinpoint what, exactly, is causing microphone problems.

 If you want to make voice chat work again and communicate with your friends, here are the fixes you should try.

## 1\. Preliminary Checks and Fixes

 Apply the following preliminary checks and fixes before moving on to the main fixes:

* Firstly, unplug your microphone from your device and reconnect it; this should resolve any temporary problems.
* Disconnect all audio input devices other than the one you intend to use,
* Restart your computer to rule out temporary glitches with the operating system.
* [Update your audio drives](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-audio-drivers-windows-11/) to ensure that outdated drivers aren't disrupting your microphone's operation.
* Whitelist Valorant from Windows Defender firewall (see [how to whitelist apps in the firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/)) and turn off third-party antivirus software. This will ensure your security suites do not restrict Valorant's voice chat capability.

 If none of the above preliminary checks and fixes resolve the issue, move on to the main troubleshooting steps.

## 2\. Ensure Your Microphone Isn't Faulty

 Next, make sure your microphone isn't faulty. You can try other games or voice recording apps and see if they can detect your voice.

 If the microphone doesn't detect voice in other apps also, connect it to a different device. If you do not hear anything from the other device either, your microphone could be faulty. In that case, get it inspected or get a replacement.

 However, if the microphone works fine on your other device and other apps on your primary device, it isn't faulty. In that case, continue applying the remaining fixes.

## 3\. Ensure the Correct Microphone Is Selected in Valorant and That It Isn't Muted

 First, ensure your desired microphone is selected in Valorant settings and it's not muted in the game. Check that by following these steps:

1. Launch Valorant.
2. Press the **Escape** key to open **Settings**.
3. At the top, click the **Audio** tab and then the **Voice Chat** tab.
4. Here, select the primary microphone you're using right now in the **Input Device** field.

5. Make sure that the **Mic Volume** isn't too low as well. If it is, move the slider to the extreme right**.**

 If you can't hear other gamers' voice chat, ensure the proper audio output device is selected and its incoming volume isn't too low.

## 4\. Ensure the Correct Microphone Is Selected in Windows and That It Isn't Muted

 If you have the correct microphone selected in Valorant settings and it isn't muted, ensure it's properly configured and unmuted in the Windows settings also. Follow these steps to confirm:

1. Open the Windows **Settings** app.
2. Navigate to **System > Sound**.  
![Go to Sound Settings From Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-go-to-sound-settings-from-windows-settings-app.jpg)
3. Under **Input** settings, select the microphone you wish to use.
4. Choose your desired microphone and make sure the **Input Volume** isn't too low.  
![Select the Correct Microphone Device in the Sound Settings of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5-select-the-correct-microphone-device-in-the-sound-settings-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)

 If you're not hearing from your friends, return to **Sound** settings and select the correct audio output device. Then, click on your primary speaker device to ensure its volume isn't too low.

## 5\. Make Your Primary Microphone and Headphone the Default Devices

 If the voice chat does not work after selecting your preferred microphone and speaker, set your preferred audio input and output devices as defaults. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **System > Sound** and click **More sound settings**.  
![Go to More Sound Settings Option in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-go-to-more-sound-settings-option-in-windows-settings-app.jpg)
3. Navigate to the **Recording** tab, right-click on your desired device, and select **Set as Default Device**.

4. Afterward, go to the **Playback** device, right-click on your desired audio output device, and select **Set as Default Device**.

## 6\. Check Valorant's Microphone Permissions

 The Windows operating system allows users to restrict any app from accessing the microphone. This setting is handy when you don't want your microphone to get unmuted in the middle of a meeting or gameplay when you don't want it to.

 Therefore, ensure you haven't mistakenly restricted Valorant from using the microphone or disabled microphone access for all apps. Follow these steps to check that:

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Go to the **Privacy and security** tab in the left sidebar.
3. Navigate to the **App permissions** settings and click on **Microphone**.  
![Go to Microphone Option in the App Permissions Settings of the Privacy and Security Tab of Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-go-to-microphone-option-in-the-app-permissions-settings-of-the-privacy-and-security-tab-of-windows-settings-app.jpg)
4. Make sure the toggle next to **Microphone access** is turned on.
5. After that, find **Valorant** in the list of apps and turn on the toggle next to it.

## 7\. Turn Off Apps' Exclusive Control Over Your Microphone and Speaker

 Windows has a handy feature that allows audio apps to take exclusive control of the drivers of hardware devices, preventing other applications from using them. Despite being useful, this permission has been linked to the issue under discussion. You should turn off this feature to rule out this possibility.

 To turn off exclusive control of the microphone, navigate to **Settings > System > Sound** and click on **More sound settings**. Afterward, go to the **Recording** tab, right-click on your desired microphone, and select **Properties**.

![Go to Recording Tab of Properties Window in More Sound Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/13-go-to-recording-tab-of-properties-window-in-more-sound-settings.jpg)

 Then, go to the **Advanced** tab and uncheck the box beside **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device**. Also, uncheck the box beside **Enable audio enhancements**.

![Disable Exclusive Control of Device and Audio Enhancements in the Recording Tab of More Sound Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/14-disable-exclusive-control-of-device-and-audio-enhancements-in-the-recording-tab-of-more-sound-settings.jpg)

 Afterward, go to the **Playback** tab, right-click your primary audio output device, and select **Properties**. Then, go to the **Advanced** tab, uncheck the exclusive control box, and turn off audio enhancements.

![Disable Exclusive Control and Audio Enhancements in the Playback Tab of More Sound Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/15-disable-exclusive-control-and-audio-enhancements-in-the-playback-tab-of-more-sound-settings.jpg)

## 8\. Change the Voice Activation Mode

 By default, Valorant's voice activation mode is set to automatic, so it transmits any voice it detects. Valorant offers another voice activation mode, Push to Talk, that allows users to press a specific key to begin a voice chat. This means that the microphone detects voice only when this button is pressed.

 Changing the voice activation mode to Push to Talk has also been reported to resolve the voice chat issue in Valorant. Therefore, follow the steps below to make this change in Valorant:

1. Launch Valorant.
2. Press the **Escape** key to open **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Audio** tab at the top and go to the **Voice Chat** tab.
4. Select the **Push to Talk** option next to **Party Voice Activation Mode**.

## Make Voice Communication Super Smooth on Valorant

 Using the voice chat feature in Valorant makes communication easier. Hopefully, you now know what causes the voice chat feature to stop working in Valorant and how to restore voice communication. If voice chat remains unresponsive despite applying all the fixes, reinstall Valorant.

 If you want to make voice chat work again and communicate with your friends, here are the fixes you should try.

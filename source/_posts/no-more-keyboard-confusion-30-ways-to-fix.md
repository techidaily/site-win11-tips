## No More Keyboard Confusion: 30 Ways to Fix

 The arrow keys are handy for day-to-day tasks; however, like any other hardware component, these keys can sometimes stop working.

 In this guide, we'll show you how to troubleshoot and fix the keyboard arrow keys not working on a Windows machine.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 Restarting your computer is the first and simplest method to try when your arrow keys are not working. This can often resolve minor software glitches that might be causing the issue.

 Before you restart, make sure to save any open documents or projects so that you don’t lose your progress.

## 2\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 If restarting your computer doesn’t fix the arrow keys not working, you can try running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This tool is designed to detect and fix common hardware problems with your computer, including keyboard issues.

To run the troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. [Run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. In the elevated command prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:  
msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic
3. The Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter will now open. Click**Next** to start the scan process, and follow the instructions on the screen.

## 4\. Try Using a Different Keyboard

 This problem can also appear if you're using a faulty keyboard. So, if the arrow keys still don’t work after applying the methods above, try using a different keyboard. You can purchase it from an electronics store or borrow one from a friend to test it out.

 Connect the new keyboard to your computer and check to see if the arrow keys are now working. If yes, it means that your original keyboard was damaged and needs to be replaced.

2. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the dialog box and press Enter to open Device Manager.
3. In the Device Manager window, expand the**Keyboards** category.

 Wait until the process is complete, then restart your computer. After the restart, check if the arrow keys are now working. If not, reinstall the keyboard driver and see if it works.

To reinstall the keyboard driver, follow these steps:

1. In Device Manager, right-click the keyboard entry and select**Uninstall device** .
2. When a popup menu appears, click**Uninstall** to confirm.

 After you uninstall it, restart your computer and the driver will be reinstalled automatically. Once your computer restarts, check if the arrow keys are now working.

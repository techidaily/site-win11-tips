## 2\. Connect a Headset Microphone with a Different PC Port

 To ensure a headset microphone or other mic device is connected properly, try plugging it into an alternative port. Are you using a headset microphone that supports USB and jack connections? If so, connect it with your PC’s jack port instead of the USB alternative.

## 3\. Check the Microphone Permission Settings for the Xbox App

## 6\. Reset the Xbox App

 The Xbox app, like others, has a**Reset** troubleshooting option you can select in Settings. That option clears the app’s data to fix issues. You can select that option to apply this potential solution by following the instructions in our [how to reset apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) article.

## 7\. Reinstall the Driver for the Audio Input Device

 A faulty or corrupted audio input device driver is another potential cause for the microphone not working with the Xbox app. Though that would also probably cause issues with using the same microphone with other apps. In this scenario, reinstalling the driver for the audio input device could be a solution, and some users have confirmed that. Try reinstalling the driver for your Xbox app microphone like this:

1. Open Device Manager by pressing**Win + X** and selecting**Device Manager** .
2. Extend**Audio inputs and outputs** by double-clicking that category.
3. Right-click the microphone you need to utilize with the Xbox app and select**Uninstall** **device** .

## Comprehensively Tackle the iCloud Install Issue on Windows

 The iCloud app for Windows makes it easy to access and sync your photos, files, calendars, contacts, passwords, and more on your Windows PC. If you use both Apple and Windows devices, it makes sense to get the iCloud app. But what if Windows doesn't allow you to download or install the iCloud app?

 If you’re irked by a similar issue yourself, here are some solutions that should help.

## 1\. Install the Media Feature Pack

 One unusual reason why you might be unable to install iCloud is if Windows Media Player is missing or disabled on your PC. In that case, you might get the error message "Your computer is missing media features" while installing iCloud.

 To fix this, simply click the **Download** button when the “Install Media Feature Pack to use iCloud” dialog appears, and then follow the on-screen prompts to finish the installation process. After that, you should be able to install iCloud on your PC.

## 2\. Turn On Media Features

 The iCloud app relies on Windows Media Player to play audio and video files on your computer. If you have previously disabled Media Features on your PC, iCloud won't install unless you re-enable them.

 To turn on Media Features on Windows:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **control panel** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. Click on **Programs and Features**.
4. Click the **Turn Windows features on or off** link in the left pane.
5. Tick the checkboxes next to **Media Features** and **Windows Media Player**.
6. Click **OK** to save changes.

[Restart your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) after completing the above steps, and then try to install iCloud again.

## 3\. Remove the Previous Version of iCloud

 Another reason why you may have trouble installing iCloud from the Microsoft Store is if an older version of the app is already available on your PC. If that’s the case, you will need to remove the previous version of iCloud to fix the issue. Here’s how you can go about it.

1. Press **Win + R** to [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/).
2. Type **appwiz.cpl** and press **Enter**.
3. In the Programs and Features window, locate and select **iCloud**.
4. Click the **Change** button at the top.
5. Select **Remove** and click **Next**.

 Once removed, you should be able to download and install the iCloud app from the Microsoft Store.

## 4\. Run the Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter

 Microsoft offers several useful [troubleshooters for fixing common issues with your Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/) computer. In this case, you can run the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter to fix any problems that may have been [preventing Windows from installing](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/block-users-installing-software-windows-computer/) iCloud.

 Since the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter doesn't come pre-installed, you will need to download it first. Here are the steps you can follow.

1. Download the [Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/E/9/7E9188C0-2511-4B01-8B4E-0A641EC2F600/MicrosoftProgram%5FInstall%5Fand%5FUninstall.meta.diagcab) on your PC.
2. Double-click the troubleshooter file to run it.
3. Click on **Next**.
4. Select the **Installing** option.
5. Select **iCloud** from the list and click **Next**.

 Allow the troubleshooter to do its thing and see if you can install iCloud after that.

## 5\. Download and Run the iCloud Installer

 Using the Microsoft Store is not the only way to install the iCloud app on your PC. If the above solutions don't help, you can try downloading the iCloud installer and running it manually. To do so, use these steps:

1. Download the [iCloud installer](http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe) from Apple’s website.
2. Right-click on the installer file and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Accept the terms in the license agreement and click **Install**.

 Wait for the installer to run and install the iCloud app on your PC.

## Start Using iCloud on Your Windows Computer

 Going through the solutions above should help fix any problems and allow you to download and install the iCloud app on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. Following that, you should be able to use services such as iCloud Photos and Drive on your Windows PC.

 If you’re irked by a similar issue yourself, here are some solutions that should help.

## Boost Bandwidth: Methods for Assessing Your Network's Velocity

 The network adapter is a critical piece of hardware that connects your Windows computer to the internet via a wired or wireless connection. In order to achieve the maximum speeds offered by your Internet Service Provider, it is important to know what network speed your card is capable of.

 Whether you want to upgrade your internet plan or diagnose your network for performance issues, there are several ways to determine the network adapter speed on Windows. Let’s go over all of them one by one.

## 1\. How to Check the Network Adapter Connection Speed Using the Settings App

 The quickest way to check the connection speed for a Wi-Fi or Ethernet adapter is through the Windows Settings app. Aside from network speed, the Settings app also provides important information like network band, local IP address, MAC address, and more.

To check the network adapter speed via the Settings app:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Select**Network & internet** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on**Properties** at the top.
4. Scroll down to the**Link speed (Receive/Transmit)** field to check the connection speed.

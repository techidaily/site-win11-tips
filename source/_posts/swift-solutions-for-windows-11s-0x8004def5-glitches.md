## Swift Solutions for Windows 11'S 0X8004DEF5 Glitches

 Microsoft bundles OneDrive with Windows 11 by default. Despite not being the most popular cloud storage service, it's hard to ignore its 5 GB free cloud storage offer. It's less than Google Drive but still lucrative because it's built into Windows.

 However, some users face the infuriating error code 0x8004def5 whenever they try to launch it. The error code indicates a problem in establishing a connection with OneDrive.

 If you face the same error and cannot log in and access your OneDrive account, don't worry. We will list out multiple methods to restore OneDrive to its working state. Let's begin.

## 1\. Terminate OneDrive and Restart the App

 Before trying out any complex fixes, you must terminate all the active instances of OneDrive. After that, restart it to check if it connects with the server. Here's how:

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to [open Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) .
2. Go to the top search bar and type**OneDrive** .
3. Switch to the**Details** tab. Right-click on the**OneDrive.exe** process and select the**End process tree** option from the context menu.
4. A popup window will launch. Click on the**End process tree** option.

5. Open the Start menu and type OneDrive. Click on the**Open** option and check if the error pops up.

## 2\. Check if OneDrive Servers Are Down

 OneDrive stores all your data in a dedicated cloud server maintained by Microsoft. Despite promising 99% uptime, it is common for cloud services like OneDrive to encounter outages. Or the service could be down due to scheduled maintenance.

 You can visit the [Microsoft Service Health page](https://portal.office.com/servicestatus) to check which services are down. Alternatively, you can use third-party websites like [DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/) . That way, you can know if other users also face the same server outage issue. If that's the case, you have to wait until Microsoft resolves the problem and brings up the OneDrive servers again.

## 3\. Completely Shut Down and Reboot Your Computer

 Background services are susceptible to glitches and crashes. If one or more such essential services encounter a glitch, it can impede apps that rely on them. However, Windows 11 enables Fast Startup by default which preserves the state of all system and kernel processes for speeding up boot time.

 Even if you shut down the system, it will not close and restart all processes and services. So, you must perform a complete shutdown. Repeat the following steps to do so:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** keys to open the command prompt with administrator privileges.
2. Now, type the following command and press the enter key:**shutdown /s /f /t 0**

## 4\. Switch Network Connections

 It is possible that your current ISP, or the network you are connected to, blocks Microsoft's servers. Many users shared they were able to fix the issue when they switched to another network. You can simply create a wireless hotspot from your phone or use USB tethering to share the internet with your Windows computer.

 After that, relaunch the OneDrive app and check if you can access your files on the network. You can also request your ISP to remove the block on your connection to access the OneDrive servers seamlessly in the future.

## 5\. Clear OneDrive Logs

 You can try clearing OneDrive telemetry log files in the app data folder. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + E** to [open the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) .
2. Go to the address bar, type the following path, and replace the "**UserName** " with your PC's username:  
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\setup\logs
3. Press the enter key to navigate to the OneDrive logs folder.
4. Locate the**userTelemetryCache.otc** file and copy it.**Paste** it to any other disk drive on your system.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command box. Type**cmd** and press the Enter key to open a new Terminal window.

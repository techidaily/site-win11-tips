You may encounter this error when setting up a new printer, after installing an update, or upgrading your router. In any case, here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this error in Windows.

 To disable Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Privacy & security** tab in the left pane.
3. Next, click on **Windows Security.**  
![Open Windows Security Windows 11 Settings 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Open-Windows-Security-Windows-11-Settings-1.jpg)
4. Finally, click on **Open Windows Security.**
5. Open the **Firewall & network protection** tab in the left pane.  
![firewall and network protection windows defender](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/firewall-and-network-protection-windows-defender.jpg)
6. Click on your currently active network **(Public / Private).**
7. Toggle the switch under **Microsoft Defender Firewall** to turn off **Firewall**. Click **Yes** if prompted by **UAC**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
8. With the Firewall disabled, create a new print job, and see if it completes successfully.

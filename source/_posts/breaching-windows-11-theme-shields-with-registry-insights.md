## But First, a Warning About the Windows Registry

 While the following tips will let you unlock "secret" themes and tweaks via the Registry, it is by no means a place you should mess around in. The Windows Registry is very important for your PC's stability, and if you make adjustments to it outside of what we cover here, you run the risk of doing damage to it.

 As such, never tweak a Registry setting without proper care, and be sure to read[how not to mess up the Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/not-accidentally-mess-windows-registry/) to learn more.

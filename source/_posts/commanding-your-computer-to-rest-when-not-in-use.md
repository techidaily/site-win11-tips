## Commanding Your Computer to Rest When Not In Use

### Key Takeaways

* Schedule a shutdown in Windows 11 and 10 using Task Scheduler for daily, weekly, or monthly tasks. Customize the start date and time.
* Add a trigger condition to your shutdown task to run it after a specified period of inactivity using Task Scheduler.
* Use Command Prompt to schedule a system shutdown with a specific timer or define a shutdown time. Customize with shutdown parameters.

 By default, Windows is configured to put your computer to sleep after a few minutes of inactivity. But if you prefer to shut down your computer every day or when idle for a long time, you can use the Task Scheduler to schedule an automatic system shutdown instead.

 Here we show you how to schedule a shutdown in Windows 11 and 10 computers.

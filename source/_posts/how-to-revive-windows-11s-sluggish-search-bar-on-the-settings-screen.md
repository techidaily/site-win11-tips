 A restart can fix many issues that are plaguing your system. When you restart your PC, you are essentially instructing it to start with a clean slate, leaving behind issues that might be causing trouble. Restarting your PC can also fix the Search issue in the Settings app.

 However, if your PC frequently requires a restart to fix this issue, the underlying problem affecting the Search feature in the Settings app persists. In that case, you should look for a more robust solution.

## 2\. Install All the Latest Windows Updates

While it can happen to anyone, a dysfunctional Search can be pretty common if you are running a Windows 11 Insider build. Either way, if you are seeing a software update on the**Windows Update** page in the Settings app, you should install it to see if it fixes the issue.

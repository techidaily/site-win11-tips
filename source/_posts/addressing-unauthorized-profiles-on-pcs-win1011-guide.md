## Addressing Unauthorized Profiles on PCs: Win10/11 Guide

 Some users can’t utilize apps downloaded from MS Store because of an error that says, “The specified user does not have a valid profile.” Users have reported the valid profile error message pops up when they click to start UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps.

 That error is a more serious one because users can’t open and utilize the Microsoft Store apps they need when it occurs. Or some users might not be able to play their favorite games like Minecraft. This is how you can fix the “specified user does not have a valid profile” error on Windows.

## 1\. Sign Out and Back Into the Microsoft Store

 This error can sometimes fix itself by simply signing out of, and back into, the Microsoft Store. So, try signing out and into the Microsoft Store app like this:

1. Open Microsoft Store by clicking the shortcut for that app on the Windows 11/10 Start menu.
2. Click the user account button at the top of the MS Store.
3. Select**Sign out** on the menu.  
![The Sign out option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/microsoft-store-window.jpg)
4. Then click the account button again to select**Sign in** .
5. Input your Microsoft account details to sign back in.

## 2\. Update Windows

 Windows patch updates can fix many bugs that affect pre-installed apps. So, updating Windows 11/10 could feasibly help to resolve this issue for some users. Our guide on [how to update Windows manually](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) includes instructions for how to check for updates using Settings.

![The Check for updates option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/windows-update-options.jpg)

 If there’s a new Windows build version available, we also recommend that you select to install it. A fresh build update can feasibly fix many potential Windows issues.

## 3\. Scan and Repair System Files

 Some users have said the System File Checker (SFC) tool can help resolve the “Specified user does not have a valid profile” error. Running an SFC scan is worth a try since that’s a straightforward potential solution to apply. Our article about [running SFC scans in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) tells you how to repair system files.

![The SFC scannow command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sfc-scannow-command.jpg)

## 4\. Take Ownership of the WindowsApps Folder

 Users have confirmed taking ownership of the WindowsApps folder is a workable fix for the “Specified user does not have a valid profile” error. Doing so will enable you to open and access the WindowsApps folder.

 First, read [how to access the WindowsApps folder on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-access-windowsapps-folder/) to learn how to find it. Then, check out our guide to [taking ownership of folders in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-own-folder/) for details about how to apply this potential solution.

 It’s recommended to input your target user account within the object name box for taking ownership.

## 5\. Change the Location of an Affected App’s Folder

 It has also been confirmed that changing the location of folders that include affected apps can resolve the “Specified user does not have a valid profile” error. You’ll also need to take ownership of the WindowsApps folder to apply this potential solution. When you’ve done that, try moving an affected app’s folder out of WhatsApps like this:

1. Bring up Windows File Explorer and the WindowsApps folder at this path:  
`C:\Program Files\WindowsApps`
2. Find the app folder specified in the error message within the WindowsApps directory.  
![The WindowsApps folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/windowsapps-folder.jpg)
3. Left-click the app's folder, hold the left button, and drag it into your User directory to move it.
4. Then open the moved folder and double-click the app’s EXE file specified within the error message.

## 6\. Uninstall CloudPaging Player and Creo Trial

 CloudPaging Player and Creo Trial (CAD software) are two conflicting programs confirmed to cause the valid profile error. Do you have either software installed on your PC? If so, remove CloudPaging Player or Creo Trial with a method in our guide for [uninstalling Windows software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .

 If you want to keep that software, you might not have to uninstall it. For instance, some users have said closing CloudPaging Player from their system trays was enough to resolve this issue. So, you can try doing that before uninstalling the software.

 If that doesn’t work, completely uninstall CloudPaging Player or Creo Trial to ensure such software cannot cause the “Specified user does not have a valid profile” error.

## 7\. Perform a Clean Startup

 CloudPaging Player and Creo Trial might not be the only apps that can cause the “user does not have a valid profile” error. So, it’s recommended users disable other apps from starting with Windows by performing a clean boot.

 You can do this by disabling third-party services in MSConfig and programs in Task Manager’s**Startup** tab as covered in our [how to perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) guide.

![The Services tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/services-tab.jpg)

 When you’ve configured a clean startup, restart your PC and try launching the app again. If that works, you can leave the boot configuration as it is. If you prefer to undo the boot changes, you’ll need to identify what app is causing the valid profile error when it’s running in the background and keep it disabled.

## 8\. Reinstall the Affected Apps

 There could be an issue with the app that only reinstalling it will resolve. So, remove an affected app by opening Apps & Features, clicking its menu button, and selecting**Uninstall** . Windows 10 users only need to select the app in Settings and click**Uninstall** to remove it.

![The Uninstall option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-uninstall-option.jpg)

 Open the app’s page within Microsoft Store. You can find it more easily by inputting the app’s title within Microsoft Store’s search box. Click the**Get** button to download and install the app you just removed.

 Does the affected app also have a desktop software version like Spotify for example? If so, the desktop software version gives you a different reinstallation option. Try reinstalling a desktop software version of the affected app if there is one available on the publisher’s website.

## 9\. Create a New User Account

 As this issue can occur because of restricted account access, setting up a new admin account could be a potential fix. Follow the steps in our [guide to fixing Windows issues by setting up a new account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-issues-creating-new-user-account/) to apply this possible solution. Then try opening the same app in the new user account. If that works, you can copy the data from your old account to the new one, as outlined within the linked guide.

![The Add account button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/add-account-button.jpg)

## Kick-Start Your Windows Apps With These Fixes

 Those are the best potential fixes for the “Specified user does not have a valid profile” error as confirmed by many users. If they’ve worked for other users, one of the above resolutions will probably fix the same issue on your PC. Then you’ll be able to open and utilize all the affected apps that previously didn’t start because of this error.

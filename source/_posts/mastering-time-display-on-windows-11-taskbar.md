## Mastering Time Display on Windows 11 Taskbar

 The system tray clock on the right side of the Windows taskbar shows the date and time. While most users find this information useful, others might consider it a source of distraction.

 As such, if you want to hide the clock and date from the taskbar, then this is the place where you need to be. We'll share three different ways by which you can configure the taskbar to hide or show the clock and date.

## 1\. Hide or Show the Clock and Date from the Taskbar by Using Windows System Settings

 The System Settings is the central hub of a Windows PC. You can use it to update Windows, manage privacy settings,[customize the taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-taskbar/) , and more.

 It's also one of the places from where you can configure the taskbar to hide or show the clock and date. You can do this by following the below instructions:

 This method only works for Windows 10\. If you are using Windows 11, you can try any other method in this article.

1. Open the**Settings** menu by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Choose the**Personalization** option.
3. Select**Taskbar** from the left panel.
4. Scroll down and click the**Turn system icon on or off** option under the**Notification** area.

5. In the new window that crops up, disable the toggle next to**Clock.**

 That's it. You've disabled the clock and date from the taskbar.

 To enable them again, head towards the above settings again and enable the toggle.

## 2\. Hide or Show the Clock and Date from the Taskbar by Using the Local Group Policy Editor

 The next utility that will help you hide or show the clock and date from the taskbar is the Local Group Policy Editor. You can use this utility to manage Windows features, sign-in and shutdown processes, and more.

 The Local Group Policy Editor is disabled by default in the Windows Home edition. To enable it, check out our guide on how to [access the group policy editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) .

 Nevertheless, here's how to use Local Group Policy Editor to configure the taskbar to hide the clock and date.

1. Open the Run dialog box, type**gpedit.msc,** and press Enter.
2. In the Local Group Policy Editor, select the**Administrative Templates** folder under**User configuration.**
3. Click the**Start Menu and Taskbar** folder.
4. Click the**Setting** option in the right pane.
5. Search for and right-click on the**Remove Clock from the system notification area** policy. Then, choose**Edit** from the context menu.
6. In the policy edit window, choose the**Enabled** option.

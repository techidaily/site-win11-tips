## Eradicating No Connection with Nvidia Experience on Windows

 GeForce Experience is a handy app for gaming optimization. However, some GeForce Experience users have posted on NVIDIA’s forum about the “unable to connect to NVIDIA” error message. Those users see that message when they start GeForce Experience.

 GeForce Experience still opens when the “unable to connect to NVIDIA” error occurs. However, users can’t download NVIDIA drivers or utilize other features like ShadowPlay in that software because of this error. As such, here is how you can fix the “unable to connect to NVIDIA” error in Windows 11 and 10.

## 1\. Erase the NSManagedTasks.xml and Restart the NVIDIA Network Service

 Users with older GeForce Experience versions have been able to fix the “Unable to connect to NVIDIA” error by deleting an NSManagedTasks.xml file. However, that file doesn’t exist for more recent GeForce Experience versions. So, not all users will be able to apply this potential fix.

 If you’re utilizing older GeForce Experience software, you might be able to resolve this issue by erasing the NSManagedTasks.xml file like this:

1. To view File Explorer, press**Win + E** .
2. Click**View** \>**Show** \>**Hidden Items** in Windows 11 File Explorer. In Windows 10 File Explorer, you’ll need to select the**Hidden Items** checkbox on the**View** tab.  
![The Hidden items option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-items-option.jpg)
3. Clear the current folder path in File Explorer’s address bar. Then input this NetService folder path and hit**Enter** :  
`C:\ProgramData\Nvidia Corporation\NetService\`  
![The NetService folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/netservice-folder.jpg)
4. Input**NSManagedTasks.xml** in Explorer’s search box to find that file within the folder.  
![The NSManagedTasks.xml file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nsmanagedtasks-file.jpg)
5. Right-click the**NSManagedTasks.xml** file and select its**Delete** option (the trash can in Windows 11).

 Once that's done, it's time to restart the NVIDIA network service.

1. Bring up the Task Manager tool, which has a useful**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc** hotkey for quick access.
2. Select Task Manager’s**Details** tab.
3. Then find and select the**NvStreamNetworkService.exe** (NVIDIA Network Service) there.  
![The Details tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-details-tab.jpg)
4. Click**End Task** to stop the service.
5. Exit the Task Manager window.
6. Next, click a**Search** box or**Type here to search** button on the Windows taskbar.
7. Enter a**services** search phrase.
8. Click**Services** inside the search tool’s results.
9. Then double-click the**NVIDIA Network Service** to access its options.
10. Select**Start** for the**NVIDIA Network Service** to restart it.
11. Press the NVIDIA Network Service Properties window’s**Apply** \>**OK** buttons.

 Now launch GeForce Experience to see if the “unable to connect” error persists.

 If you can’t find a NetService folder or NSManagedTasks.xml file, then this isn’t the “Unable to connect” resolution for you. Proceed with the other potential fixes below.

## 2\. Run the Relevant NVIDIA Services

 Some GeForce Experience users have confirmed they’ve been able to fix the Unable to connect to NVIDIA” error by starting NVIDIA services. Thus, this error can seemingly occur because of disabled NVIDIA services.

 Here is how you can enable and run NVIDIA services in Windows 10 and 11:

1. Open Services as instructed in steps 11-13 of the first resolution above.
2. Then double-click an NVIDIA service in the window to open its properties window.  
![The Services window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-services.jpg)
3. Select the**Start** option in the properties window if the service isn’t running (stopped).

## 3\. Manually Update the NVIDIA Graphics Driver With Device Manager

 Updating the NVIDIA graphics driver is a potential resolution some users confirm to fix the “Unable to connect” error. However, users can’t update their graphics drivers with GeForce Experience because of the issue. Instead, manually update your NVIDIA GPU’s driver with Device Manager like this:

1. Open the[NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) download website.
2. Select your graphics card model and PC OS in the drop-down menus and click**Search** .  
![The NVIDIA driver downloads page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nvidia-driver-downloads.jpg)
3. Select**Download** to obtain the NVIDIA driver pack.
4. Then open Device Manager, which you can access by right-clicking your**Start** button in Windows and selecting the shortcut for that tool. You can also use one of the other[ways to open the Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) .
5. Next, click the arrow beside the**Display adapters** to view that category.
6. Right-click the NVIDIA GPU to select**Update driver** on the context menu.  
![The Update driver option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/update-driver-option.jpg)
7. Select**Browse my computer** to locate a driver package.
8. Click**Browse** to select the downloaded driver package.  
![the-browse-button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-browse-button.jpg)
9. Select**Next** to install the selected NVIDIA driver.

## 4\. Edit the Hosts File

 Hosts is a file for mapping domain names. The “Unable to connect to NVIDIA” error occurs when the localhost value in it equals 0.0.0.0\. Some GeForce Experience users have fixed the “Unable to connect to NVIDIA” error by changing the localhost value to 127.0.0.1 in the hosts file like this:

1. Open File Explorer and input this folder location in the folder address bar:  
`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`
2. Click the**hosts** file with the mouse’s right button and select**Open with** .  
![The etc folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/etc-folder.jpg)
3. Then click**Notepad** to view the hosts file in that text editor.
4. If the localhost is set to**0.0.0.0** , or another value, change it to**127.0.0.1** as shown in the image below.  
![The localhost value](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/localhost-value.jpg)
5. Then click**File** at the top of Notepad to select a**Save** option.

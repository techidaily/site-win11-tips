## Take Notes, No Downloads: Windows 11 Secrets

 If you’re looking for a simple and quick way to take notes while working on your PC, you don’t have to download software to write things down. Windows offers some useful note-taking tools to quickly jot things down.

 If like most people, your memory is not perfect, you can use these tools to remind yourself of important things while working. Here are five easy ways to take notes on Windows 11 without downloading any software.

## 1\. Use Notepad

 Notepad is a long-term favorite for offline note-taking on your PC. Its simplicity is liked by many, although since the release of Windows 11, Notepad has added some extra features to aid your writing experience. Notepad now offers dark mode support and options to change the font style and size.

 Opening Notepad in Windows 11 is simple. The app is pre-installed on all Windows devices. Hit the **Windows** key to open the Start menu, then search for “Notepad.”

 If you use the app often, you can create a desktop shortcut for faster access. Navigate to the Start menu, hit **All Apps**, and find Notepad down the alphabetical list. Then drag the app to a space on the desktop to create a shortcut. You can also access Notepad faster by [pinning an app to the Windows 11 Taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-taskbar-pin-almost-anything/).

 WordPad is another pre-installed app offering a great method to take notes without downloading software. The app’s simple design resembles Notepad but offers more advanced features—notably its rich text editor—to upgrade your note-taking.

 With its rich text editor, you can change the font color and style, add bulleted lists, and highlight text. WordPad also offers a feature to send documents directly as an email. Hit **File** and select **Send as email**.

 To access the app, go to the Start menu and search for “WordPad.” Files can be saved as a plain text file (as used in Notepad) or as a rich text document (.rtf) if you’d like to import your notes into other software.

## 3\. Try Windows Sticky Notes

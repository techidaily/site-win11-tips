## 5 Ways to Permanently Disable Microsoft Defender in Windows 11

 Microsoft bundles an antivirus program with every copy of the Windows operating system. Microsoft Defender was released in 2006 and has since been integral to every new Windows operating system release. Surprisingly, it is good at identifying and isolating malware on your system and offering real-time protection.

 But have you ever tried disabling Microsoft Defender? Unless you install a third-party antivirus program, it continues to run and monitor your system. Even if you disable the real-time protection, it turns back on after some time. Don’t worry! We will discuss multiple methods to disable Microsoft Defender for good.

## Why Does Microsoft Make It Difficult to Disable Microsoft Defender?

 Microsoft Defender offers robust security against malware and has evolved over time. You can use it to keep your system safe from malware and do not need to spend on any third-party antivirus app. But Microsoft realizes that users can expose their system to attackers if they disable Microsoft Defender completely.

 So, as a fail-safe method, Microsoft Defender turns back on after some time, even if you disable it. In the older version of Windows, disabling real-time protection was enough, but now it takes a lot more to disable Microsoft Defender.

 But what if you want to install and use a third-party app that Microsoft Defender repeatedly flags as malicious? Or if you want to reduce the load on your system resources? Well, then you have to dive deep into Windows Security settings and disable real-time protection as well as other associated protection measures.

 This guide will teach you how to disable Microsoft Defender permanently. It will stay off until you undo the steps you perform in this guide. If you only want Microsoft Defender to turn off for a short amount of time, check out [how to turn off Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-microsoft-defender-windows-11/) for a more temporary solution.

If you want to completely disable Microsoft Defender (including real-time protection), you must disable Tamper Protection first. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press**Win + S** and type Windows Security. Click on the**Open** option to launch the app.
2. Click on the**Virus and threat protection** option on the home page.
3. Find the Virus and threat protection settings section and click on the**Manage settings** option.

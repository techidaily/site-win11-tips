 To shade every other row in Excel, highlight your dataset and go to Home > Format as Table, then choose from the menu that appears the alternating color style you want. Alternatively, use conditional formatting to apply alternating row colors to your entire spreadsheet.

 One way to make spreadsheet data easier to read is by applying colored shading to alternating rows. Microsoft Excel offers a couple of ways to [alternate row color](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/from-obscurity-to-influence-5-strategies-to-dominate-reddit-advertising/) so you can whichever method works best for you.

##  Shade Every Other Row With a Table and Style

 By using a table with an alternating row color style, you can apply shading with little effort. You can do this by [converting your data to a table](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-convert-your-best-videography-into-melodic-mp3s-insta/) or choosing a style for an existing table.

###  Convert and Style a Table With Alternating Colors

 If you don't have your data formatted as a table, you can convert it and apply a style at the same time. Select all of the data you want to format and head to the Home tab.

 Click the Format as Table drop-down arrow and pick an alternating row style.

##  Use Conditional Formatting to Color Every Other Row

 Maybe you don't want to format your data as a table. In this case, you can [use conditional formatting](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-asmr-video-insights/) to apply alternating row colors.

 If you only want to apply the color to a certain cell range, select those cells. To color all alternating rows in the whole sheet, click the Select All (triangle) button on the top left of the sheet.

 Go to the Home tab, select the Conditional Formatting drop-down arrow in the Styles section, and choose "New Rule."

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 At the top of the pop-up window below Select a Rule Type, pick "Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format."

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 In the bottom section below Edit the Rule Description, enter the following formula in the "Format Values Where This Formula is True" box:

=MOD(ROW(),2)=0

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 Select "Format" and choose the color you want to use for the alternating rows on the Fill tab. You can also use a pattern with or without a color if you like. You'll see a preview of the color at the bottom. If you're happy with it, click "OK."

 You'll then be back to the New Formatting Rule box. Here again, you can confirm the color in the Preview at the bottom. Click "OK" to apply the rule.

 If you want to apply a color to the odd rows as well, create another new conditional rule and use this formula:

=MOD(ROW(),2)=1

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 Follow the same steps to choose the color and apply the rule.

## 4\. How to Install Microsoft Defender Application Guard Using Command Prompt

 If you are comfortable with the command prompt, you can also install Microsoft Defender Application Guard using the Command Prompt. Follow the steps here:

`Dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:"Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`
5. When Command Prompt asks you to restart, type**Y** and hit Enter to complete this operation.

 Once you restart your computer, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be installed and ready to use. In case you want to uninstall the Application Guard, you can do so by using the same command prompt steps. Just make sure to run the following command instead:

`Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:"Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`

 At this point, you may be asked to restart your computer. To proceed, type**Y** and press Enter. After restarting, you will have successfully installed Microsoft Defender Application Guard on your system.

## 5\. How to Install Microsoft Defender Application Guard Using Windows PowerShell

`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`
3. Now press**Enter** on your keyboard to execute it.
4. When PowerShell asks you to restart your computer, type**Y** and hit Enter.

 Upon restarting the computer, you will have successfully installed Microsoft Defender Application Guard on your system. Now you can make sure that you are browsing in a secure and protected environment.

`Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`

 Now press Enter on your keyboard to execute the command and restart your system. Once it is done, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be uninstalled from your PC.

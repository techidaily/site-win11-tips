## Enabling Apple's Messaging Protocol in Windows 10

### Key Takeaways

* For your iPhone and Windows computer to communicate, you will need to connect them over Bluetooth.
* To sync contacts and messages to your Windows PC, you'll need to install the Link to Windows app on your iPhone.
* Use the Phone Link app on Windows to send and receive iMessages.

 Looking at your iPhone to check your messages can be distracting when you're working. Apple's excellent cross-device support means that you can easily send and receive messages on a Mac without breaking your flow. But did you know that it's as simple if you have a Windows PC, too?

## How to Use Phone Link to Get iMessages on Windows

 If you're running the latest version of Windows, the Microsoft Phone Link app should already be installed on your device. If not, you may have to[update Windows on your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) first. You’ll use this app to sync contacts and messages from your iPhone.

### Download the Link to Windows App on Your iPhone

 You’ll need to download a Microsoft app called Link to Windows on your iPhone from the[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/link-to-windows/id6443686328) . Tap**Open** to launch the app to get started.

## An Alternative Method to Use iMessage on Windows

 If you don't want to use the Phone Link, there is an alternate, albeit more complicated, way to interact with iMessage on your Windows PC. This method involves using the Remote Desktop extension for Chrome, which you can download from the[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/inomeogfingihgjfjlpeplalcfajhgai) . However, you will also need a Mac and Windows computer and install the extension on both devices.

 Launch Messages on your Mac and share the screen with the Windows PC using the Remote Desktop extension. You can then interact with iMessage on the PC through the shared screen.

 If your messages aren’t going through or the Remote Desktop extension isn’t working, first check whether the[Windows PC is connected to the Internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-connect-to-wifi/) and ensure you have a[stable network connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-stability-internet-connection-windows/) . Of course, if you aren't able to send someone a message, whether on a PC or your iPhone, the person may have[blocked you on iMessage](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-if-someone-blocked-you-imessage/) .

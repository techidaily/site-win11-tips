## Advanced Visual Settings for Secure Web Experience in Windows 11

Microsoft has added an option allowing you to turn on advanced graphics in their Application Guard for Windows 11\. In this guide, we'll show you how to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge.

## 2\. How to Enable Advanced Graphics via Registry Editor

 If you don't like the idea of tinkering with the Windows Settings page, you can also use the Registry Editor to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge. But keep in mind that tweaking the Windows Registry is a risky endeavor, so proceed carefully.

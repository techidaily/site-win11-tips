## Avoid Ephemeral Backgrounds on Win11

 After upgrading to Windows 11 or installing a recent system update, you might find that your background keeps changing automatically. At first, it’s no big deal, since you can always set it back to the one you want. But when it happens a couple of times, especially when you head back to the desktop after some time or restart your computer, something’s not right.

 Here are some solutions to stop Windows 11 from changing the background.

## 1\. Make Sure the Theme Isn't Changing Your Wallpaper

 If you’ve recently installed a new theme, it could be that it changes the background image after a while. You can use one of the [ways to switch your wallpaper on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-desktop-wallpaper/) if you find this behavior distracting or undesirable. Hopefully, this will prevent the background from automatically changing.

## 2\. Turn Off Slideshow in Personalization Settings

 If it’s not the theme that’s automatically changing the background on your Windows 11 PC, it could be that you’ve set your background to be a slideshow. A slideshow background will change its image after a set amount of time, like one minute, 30 minutes, or a day.

Here’s how you can stop that from happening:

1. Right-click**Start** and select**Settings** in the Power Menu.  
![the windows 11 power menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/windows-11-start-power-menu.jpg)
2. Head to**Personalize > Background** .
3. If it says**Slideshow** in the dropdown next to**Personalize your background** , click on it and select**Picture** or**Solid color** .

Now your background should remain fixed.

## 3\. Disable Windows Sync Settings

 Do you have more than one Windows device? Do you use your Microsoft account on all of them?

 The problem with this is that if you change something on one device, such as the theme or background, it can sync it with the other devices since they’re linked by the Microsoft account. Turning off the ability to sync settings can help solve the problem.

Here’s how to do that:

1. Right-click**Start** and select**Settings** in the Power Menu.
2. Go to**Accounts > Windows backup** .
3. If you don’t want to sync your Windows 11 PC with anything, turn off the toggle next to**Remember my preferences** .

4. If you don't want to sync the settings only, click the**down arrow** next to the toggle for**Remember my preferences** to expand the section and uncheck**Other Windows settings** .

 Now when you change the background or theme on another Windows device, it won’t affect this one.

## 4\. Use a Local Account

 Another way to disable Windows’ ability to sync settings across devices is to switch to a local account. This will disconnect the Windows account on your computer from your Microsoft account and its services.

 Follow the below steps to use a local account instead of a Microsoft account:

1. Right-click**Start** and select**Settings** in the Power Menu.
2. Head to**Accounts > Your Info** , and then click on**Sign in with a local account instead** in the**Account settings** section.  
![link to sign into windows 11 with a local account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/windows-11-sign-in-local-account.jpg)
3. Follow the steps to set up your local account.

 Now your Windows account on this computer will be isolated from the rest of your Windows devices, and the settings should no longer sync.

## 5\. Lock the Background Settings

 Sometimes, it’s not that Windows is changing the background so much as someone else is doing it when they use your computer. You can tell them to stop if you know who it is, but if many people use the PC, you can simply [disable your Windows background settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-others-change-windows-desktop-background/) . This will prevent others from changing them.

## 6\. Uninstall the Most Recent Windows Update

 While keeping your computer updated is a good idea, if the background switching problem is too much of a nuisance, uninstalling a recent update can help get rid of the issue. If this is what you want to do, read our guide on the [ways you can uninstall updates on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/manually-uninstall-windows-10-updates/) .

## Now Your Background Should Stop Changing by Itself

 Having the Windows background set up the way you want can make Windows more enjoyable. But if it keeps changing, it can dampen your experience. If you can’t take it anymore, just try the fixes above, and see which one works for you.

 And if all else fails, you might need to give your Windows 11 computer the good old reset.

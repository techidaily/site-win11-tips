##  Track Your Pet's Health

 Maybe the health tracker you need is for your furry family member. This [Pet Health Log](https://templates.office.com/en-us/pet-health-log-tm06128278) lets you track immunizations, medications, and known conditions. You can also log vet visits with complete details for tests performed, diagnosis, prescribed action and medication, and more.

![Pet Health Log](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PetHealthLog-ExcelHealthTrackers.png) 

 If you have more than one pet, [copy the original sheet](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-science-behind-auto-hdr-and-cameras-ai-powered-shooting-modes/) to another tab before entering the details. You can then [rename the tab](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-xiaomi-14-ultra-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) with your pet's name. Do the same for each pet in your household for a handy record of everyone's health history.

 The Pet Health Log is only available for the Excel desktop version, not the web.

 Even if you wear a [fitness tracking device](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-health-advocacy-through-strategic-social-media-plays/) or use a [heath tracking app](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-tune-up-the-mundane-how-to-add-custom-ringtones-and-sounds-for-a-unique-auditory-experience-on-android/), it may not include every category you need. With these Excel templates, health tracking couldn't be simpler. Plus, if you wanted to combine data, most fitness trackers let you export your data as a [CSV file](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-from-followers-to-fans-a-guide-to-thriving-instagram-presence/) or other file type that you can easily [import into Excel](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-establishing-a-mac-based-sports-media-outlet/).

## Mastering the Art of Teamwork: Eradicating MS Teams Error 80080300

 Many users utilize Microsoft Teams, a free messaging app with Windows 11\. However, some users can’t use that app because of the Microsoft Teams error 80080300\. The 80080300 error displays a message that says, “we’re sorry, we’ve run into an issue.”

## 1\. Disconnect Your Microsoft Work or School Account

## 2\. Run Teams in Compatibility Mode

 Teams users have had some joy fixing the 80080300 error by selecting to run that app in compatibility mode. That’s a surprising potential fix considering Teams comes bundled with Windows 11, but users have confirmed it works. So, try running Microsoft Teams in compatibility mode as follows:

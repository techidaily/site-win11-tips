## 1\. Check for Physical Damage

 If your shift key suddenly stops working, it could be a sign of physical damage. To check for physical damage, turn off your computer and carefully inspect the key for dirt or debris. You can also turn your laptop upside down and shake it gently. If you find any, use a soft brush or compressed air to gently clean the area.

 If you need help, see our guide on [how to clean your keyboard and sterilize viruses and bacteria](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-keyboard/).

## 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If you've confirmed there are no physical connection issues, [restart your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/). This gives the machine a fresh start and could potentially resolve minor software glitches that might cause the shift key to not work. Remember to save files or applications before shutting down to protect your work.

 This will ensure that none of your work is lost because of the restart. After restarting, open a text document and try typing again. If the shift key remains unresponsive, there may be an issue with your software settings.

## 3\. Check Your Keyboard Settings

 The Filter key is an accessibility feature on Windows that could interfere with your keyboard's normal functioning. It ignores brief or repeated keystrokes, which may fail to process the input entirely. To prevent this from happening, try disabling the Filter key option and see if it solves the issue.

 Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. From the left sidebar, click on the **Accessibility** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Interaction** section and click the **Keyboard** option.
4. From here, locate the **Filter keys** option and toggle it off.  
![Turn Off Filter Keys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/turn-off-filter-keys.jpg)

 Once done, close the Settings window and see if the shift key is now working.

## 4\. Update or Reinstall Keyboard Drivers

 If the shift key is still not working, it could be an issue with your keyboard drivers. Outdated or corrupt drivers may cause compatibility issues and prevent hardware from functioning. To fix this issue, update your keyboard drivers using the below instructions.

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** in the text field and hit **Enter**.
3. In the Device Manager window, expand the **Keyboards** section.
4. Right-click on your keyboard device and select **Update driver**.  
![Update the Keyboard driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/update-the-keyboard-driver.jpg)
5. On the next page, select the **Search automatically for drivers** option.  
![Search automatically for drivers-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/search-automatically-for-drivers-1.jpg)

 Now follow the instructions displayed on your screen to complete the process. After that, restart your computer and see if it solves the issue. If not, reinstall the keyboard drivers. This resolves compatibility issues and ensures hardware functions properly.

 To reinstall the keyboard drivers, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select **Device Manager** from the list.
2. Double-click on **Keyboards** and select **Uninstall device**.  
![Uninstall device in Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/uninstall-device-in-device-manager.jpg)
3. Click **Uninstall** again to confirm the action.

 Now close the Device Manager window and restart your computer. Windows will now automatically install drivers on startup. After that, test the shift key again and see if the problem is solved.

## 5\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 Hardware and devices troubleshooter is a Windows program that scans your computer for hardware-related issues. Running this troubleshooter diagnoses and resolves underlying problems that may cause the shift key not to work.

 To run this troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type "msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic" in the text field and hit Enter.
3. In the Troubleshooting window, click **Advanced** and check the box next to **Apply repairs automatically**.  
![Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. Click **Next** and follow the instructions displayed on your screen.

 The troubleshooter will now scan your computer for hardware-related issues. When it's done, restart your computer and check if the shift key now works.

## 6\. Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter

 This tool is similar to the hardware and devices troubleshooter but specifically addresses keyboard-related problems. It detects software conflicts or other issues that may prevent the shift key from functioning. Follow these steps to run this troubleshooter:

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings window.
2. From the left sidebar, click on the **System** tab.
3. Scroll down in the right pane and click on **Troubleshoot**.
4. On the next page, click **Other troubleshooters**.  
![Other troubleshooters](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/other-troubleshooters.jpg)
5. Locate the **Keyboard** option in the list, then click **Run**.

 Wait until the troubleshooter finishes and restart your computer. After that, check if the shift key functions normally.

## 7\. Scan for Malware

 Viruses or suspicious programs interfere with keyboard functionality, leading to unresponsive keys. To check if this is the issue, [scan your computer for malicious software](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/).

 You can perform a full system scan using the Windows Security app. Here's how to do it:

1. Click on Start and search for Windows Security.
2. From the search results, open the **Windows Security** app.
3. Click on **Virus & threat protection** from the left sidebar.
4. On the right side of the page, click on **Scan options**.  
![Scan options in Windows Security](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/scan-options-in-windows-security.jpg)
5. Next, check the **Full scan** box and click **Scan now**.

![Full Scan Windows Security](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/full-scan-windows-security.jpg)

## 8\. Try a Different Keyboard

 If the suggested solutions do not solve the problem, chances are that the issue lies with your keyboard hardware. To isolate this from other causes, try a different keyboard and check if the shift key works now.

 If you don't have another keyboard, open a virtual one. This is an on-screen keyboard that lets you type without physical keys. To access it, press **Win + R** on your keyboard. This will open the Run command dialog box.

 Type **osk** in the text field and hit **Enter**. Now test the shift key on this virtual keyboard. If it works now, you should consider replacing the physical keyboard.

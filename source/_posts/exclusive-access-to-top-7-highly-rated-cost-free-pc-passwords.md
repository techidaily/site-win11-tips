## Exclusive Access to Top 7 Highly Rated, Cost-Free PC Passwords

 Password generators help you maintain good password hygiene. You can stop using a single password everywhere or an insecure password because generating a complex password is cumbersome.

 Most password managers feature built-in password generators. But if you are looking for a standalone password generator app for Windows, these recommendations should help.

## What Makes a Password Strong?

 Before you dive into generating passwords, it's a good idea to learn [what makes a truly secure password](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-makes-a-password-truly-secure/) . Password generators often give you free rein over what your password contains, such as numbers, symbols, and spaces. A good password is complex enough to be secure, but simple enough to be memorable.

 A strong password often consists of two things: length and randomness. A longer password takes longer to break as any password cracker would have to work all the possible combinations to break it.

 Similarly, the randomness of the password is another critical aspect of how strong a password is. You don't have to just use lower-case letters; you can also mix in upper-case, numbers, and symbols. The greater the randomness, the harder it is to break.

 While there are plenty of [online password generators](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-websites-to-generate-a-safe-and-strong-password/) available, desktop password generators come with the additional feature to save passwords, alongside some advanced features.

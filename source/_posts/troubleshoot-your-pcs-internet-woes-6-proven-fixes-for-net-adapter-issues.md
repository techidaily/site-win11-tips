## 1\. Check the Network Adapter Status

 Device Manager on Windows makes it easy to view, manage, and update various hardware devices connected to your system. You can use it to examine the status of your network adapter and check if it is encountering any particular errors.

 Here's how you can go about checking the status of your network adapter on Windows.

1. Right-click the **Start icon** or use the **Win + X** keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu.
2. Select **Device Manager** from the list.
3. Expand **Network adapters**.
4. Right-click on your network adapter and select **Properties**.
5. Select the **General** tab.
6. Check the message under **Device status**.

 If you see an error under **Device status**, write it down and then look for solutions to fix that particular error first.

 Is the network adapter entry missing from the Device Manager? If so, you can ask Windows to scan your system's hardware again. To do so, click the **Action** menu in the Device Manager window and select **Scan for hardware changes**.

 Wait for the Device Manager window to detect the network adapter, and then check its status using the steps mentioned above.

 The Device Manager window will refresh and your network adapter should start working after that.

## 4\. Update or Reinstall the Network Adapter Driver

 The network adapter driver installed on your computer facilitates communication between Windows and your network hardware. If this driver is outdated or malfunctioning, Windows may have difficulty establishing network connections. You can try updating the network adapter driver to see if that gets things moving again.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** in the text box and press **Enter** to open the Device Manager.
3. Expand **Network adapters**.

![Search for Updated Network Adapter Driver on Windows Update](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/search-for-updated-network-adapter-driver-on-windows-update.jpg)

 Windows will now check if any updates are available for your drivers and download them.

 If the problem persists even after updating the network adapter driver, it is likely that the driver is corrupted. In that case, you will need to uninstall the driver from your PC.

 If you need help with that, check out [how to uninstall drivers in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstall-drivers/). After removing the driver, restart your PC, and Windows will automatically reinstall the missing driver during boot.

## 5\. Reset the Winsock Catalog

 Winsock (short for Windows Sockets) is a programming interface that allows your apps and programs to communicate with network protocols and services. If there’s an issue with this program, you could experience various network-related problems, including the one discussed here.

 You can try resetting the Winsock data on your PC to see if that restores normalcy. To do so, use these steps:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Windows PowerShell** in the text box and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.

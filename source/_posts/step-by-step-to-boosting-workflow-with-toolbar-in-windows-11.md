## How to Enable the Widgets Toolbar in Windows 11

 In order to enable and use the widget's toolbar, you will need to [download ViveTool from GitHub](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases). Once the zip file has been downloaded, extract its contents into the folder **C:/ViVeTool** on your computer.

 After completing the above steps, open the command prompt with admin rights. To do this, [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) or [use the Windows Search tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/). For more information, see our in-depth tutorial on [how to run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).

 In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and press **Enter**:

c:\vivetool\vivetool /enable /id:40772499

 Once the command is executed on your computer, you will see a message saying "Successfully set feature configuration (s)". After executing the above command, restart your device for the changes to take effect.

 So that's it. You have now enabled the new toolbar in Windows 11\. It provides various useful features, including maps, news, and other options that you can find through its popular services.

 In case you experience any unfavorable results after using the widget toolbar, you may want to disable it. For this, open the Command Prompt window with admin access and run the following command:

c:\vivetool\vivetool /disable /id:40772499

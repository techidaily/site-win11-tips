## 1\. Check Screen Timeout Settings

 Before we get to any advanced troubleshooting tips, itâ€™s a good idea to double-check the screen timeout settings on Windows. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Navigate to **System > Power & battery**.
3. Click on **Screen and sleep** to expand it.

## 2\. Configure Screen Saver Settings

 Incorrectly configured screen saver settings on Windows can also be the cause of this issue. Here's how you can configure Windows to display the lock screen after you resume from a screensaver.

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **change screen saver** in the box and select the first result that appears.
3. In the Screen Saver Settings window, set the preferred wait time.
4. Tick the **On resume, display logon screen** checkbox.
5. Hit **Apply** followed by **OK**.  
![Screen Saver Settings on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screen-saver-settings-on-windows.jpg)

 Once you complete the above steps, Windows should lock your system once the screen saver activates.

## 3\. Check Screen Saver Settings in the Local Group Policy

 If the issue remains even after you configure the screen saver settings, you will need to check the policies related to the screen saver and make sure they are configured correctly.

 As you may be aware, the Local Group Policy Editor is only available on Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. However, if you are using the Home edition, you can use a workaround to [access the Local Group Policy Editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

 To modify group policies related to screen saver, use these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Control Panel > Personalization**.
5. Double-click the **Enable Screen Saver** policy on your right.
6. Select the **Enabled** option.
7. Hit **Apply** and then click **OK**.
8. Similarly, enable the **Password protect the screen saver** policy as well.

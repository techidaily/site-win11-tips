## Double-Tap for APKs: A User-Friendly Guide in Win 11

 You've set up the Windows Subsystem for Android, and you're ready to start installing those APK files. Turns out, it's a bit of a process. Wouldn't it be better if we could just double-click those APK files?

 Let's have a look at how to set it so that it works exactly like that.

## How to Download WSA-QuickInstall ![screenshot of the wsa quickinstall files](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_wsa_quickinstall_files.jpg)

 WSA-QuickInstall is what we'll use to achieve a more seamless APK install process. This simple app is found on [the WSA-QuickInstall GitHub page](https://github.com/officialnochill/WSA-QUICKINSTALL) . All you need to do is extract it somewhere you'll remember, and you're ready to move on.

 WSA-QuickInstall can be falsely identified as a threat by Windows Defender. You may need to [add an exception to Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-security-exclusions/) in order to use the app.

## How to Set Up WSA-QuickInstall ![screenshot of wsa quickinstall drag and drop functionality](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_wsa_quickinstall_drag_and_drop.jpg)

 Setting up WSA-QuickInstall is easy. Once extracted, you'll have two files and a folder. Keep them all together, but pay attention to**install.exe** , as this will be the executable that we use to actually sideload and install the apps.

 To make sure WSA-QuickInstall is working correctly, drag any APK file you have onto install.exe.

 A command prompt window may appear for a time, and then your system will install the app.

 That's all good and well, but how do we enable the seamless double-click install functionality?

## How to Set Up the Default Program for APK Files ![screenshot of changing default program in windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_wsa_quickinstall_change_default_program.jpg)

 First, make sure you have an APK file handy to install. Then, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on your APK file and click**properties**
2. In the properties window, click**Change** located next to the**Opens with:** section
3. In the next window, hit**More apps**
4. Then scroll to the bottom and click**Look for another app on this PC**
5. Navigate to where you extracted the files and click**install.exe**

 It's as easy as that. Now, whenever you double-click on an APK file, Windows will automatically install it for you, hassle-free.

## Make Installing APK Files Easier

 While the Windows Subsystem for Android is an excellent and welcomed feature for Windows 11, a lot of users wish it was a little easier to use.

 Hopefully, now it is. Have fun adding Android apps to your system with half the hassle involved.

## How to Thrive in Free Championship Football Simulator

 Championship Manager 01/02 was one of the highlights of the Championship Manager series, the precursor to the Football Manager franchise.

 Eidos Interactive made Championship Manager 01/02 a freely available download from 2008, and online communities have kept this classic retro game alive and kicking ever since. This is how you can play the Championship Manager 01/02 soccer management game on a Windows 11/10 PC.

## 2\. Download and Install WinCDEmu

 As the downloaded Championship Manager 01/02 file is an ISO, you will need to mount its image with WinCDEmu. WinCDEmu is one of the [best freeware software packages for mounting ISO files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-free-alternatives-daemon-tools-mounting-image-files/) on a Windows PC.

## Reversing Administrative Controls on Windows Defense Measures

 Some users have reported they can’t set Windows Security options because of an error that says, “This setting is managed by your administrator.” Those users see that error message just above options within the**Virus & threat protection** and**App & browser tabs** of that app. Consequently, they can’t turn on important Windows Security settings there that are grayed out and disabled.

 That issue has little to do with admin rights. Many users who encounter the issue are already utilizing Windows administrator accounts. This is how you can fix the “setting is managed by your administrator” error in Windows 11.

## 1\. Check for and Install Available Windows 11 Updates

 Although not the most likely potential solution, some users have said installing available Windows 11 updates helped them resolve this error. Patchers for Windows 11 usually address Windows bugs reported by users.

 If you're not sure how to do this, visit [how to install Windows 11 updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) for a step-by-step guide.

## 2\. Reset the Windows Security and Settings Apps

## 3\. Uninstall Third-Party Antivirus Software

 Some third-party antivirus utilities can disable Windows Security features they effectively replace. If you’ve installed an overlapping third-party antivirus product, uninstalling it may resolve Windows Security’s administrator error. Uninstall antivirus software with a method within our guide on [how to remove Windows programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) to see if that resolves the issue.

![The uninstaller tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-uninstaller-tool.jpg)

 Should this solution work, the issue will likely reoccur if you reinstall the same third-party antivirus virus software. Then you would have to choose between using the third-party antivirus utility or Windows Security.

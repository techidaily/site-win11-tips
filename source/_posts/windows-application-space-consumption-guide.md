## Windows Application Space Consumption Guide

 With the ever-increasing number of apps and programs available for Windows, it's easy to clutter your PC's storage with non-essential apps.

 Whether you want to check the storage usage of your Microsoft Store apps or traditional desktop programs, this guide will help you with both.

## 1\. Check How Much Space Your Apps or Programs Are Using via the Settings App

1. Press **Win + I** or use one of [the many ways to launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Navigate to **System > Storage** and look for the **Installed apps** section to check the total storage occupied by your apps.

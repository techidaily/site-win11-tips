## How to Fix Clipchamp Not Installing on Windows 11

 If you are unable to install this free video editing tool on your system, try out the following fixes to successfully install and run it on your computer.

### 1\. Completely Close and Relaunch the Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store app can become unresponsive and fail to install the app on your system. So, you must terminate the app and restart it. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app. Navigate to the left-hand side menu and click on the**Apps** option.
2. Click on the**Installed Apps** option. Then click on the**Search for app** option and type Microsoft Store.
3. Click on the three horizontal dots and select the**Advanced options** from the context menu.  
![Completely Close and Relaunch Microsoft Store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/completely-close-and-relaunch-microsoft-store.jpg)
4. Scroll down and click on the**Terminate** button. It will end the Microsoft process and close the app.

### 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If terminating the app doesn't do anything, do a system restart. It will clear all the apps from the memory, close all the background apps and services, and restart them. Do not use shutdown because Microsoft enables Fast start-up by default and that doesn't close system and kernel-level processes from the memory.

 After your computer restarts, launch Microsoft Store and try to install the Clipchamp app on your system.

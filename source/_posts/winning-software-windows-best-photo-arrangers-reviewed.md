## 5\. SysTweak Photo Organizer ![photo organizer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/photo-organizer.jpg)

 Photo Organizer is a photo organizing and management utility that lets you find scattered images on your system and organize them at a single location.

 Photo Organize is different than other organizers in this list. Instead of simply locating the images, it lets you move all the photos to a single location. It features an impressive import function that can find scattered images, search old backups, skip duplicate files, and import them all to one location.

 It will automatically organize the photos in sub-folders based on the date taken, camera mode, etc. You can also batch rename files, view files in the preview, and add them to your favorites.

 On the flip side, importing images can feel slower. This concerns the fact that the app copies or moves the scattered images to a central location for easier management. It also doesn’t allow you to color label or rate photos.

## Accelerating Battery Awareness: Custom Notification for Win11 Users

 Laptop batteries degrade when kept charged at 100 percent. The more you leave a laptop plugged in, the more its battery will deteriorate over time. So, some users no doubt try to preserve their laptops’ battery lifespans by leaving them unplugged as much as possible.

 Windows doesn’t incorporate a high-battery notifier (alert) for informing you when a plugged-in laptop is fully charged or close to it. Such a feature would be useful for users who prefer to leave their laptops unplugged when they can. This is how you can add a full battery charge alert to Windows 11/10 with three apps.

## How to Add a Full Battery Charge Alert With Battery Notification

 Battery Notification is a Microsoft Store app you can utilize in Windows 11/10\. That app enables you to set both high and low-battery alert notifications. The basic app is freely available, but you can upgrade it to one with battery analytics for $4.99\. You can set up a fully charged notifier with Battery Notification as follows:

1. Bring up the [Battery Notification](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/battery-notification/9WZDNCRD31FK) app page in a browser.
2. Click Battery Notification’s**Get in Store App** option.
3. Select**Open in Microsoft Store** to access a download option for the app outside the browser.
4. Click**Get** to install Battery Notification.
5. Select Battery Notification on the Start menu to open its window.
6. Next, select the**Always Allowed** option if prompted to enable the app to run in the background.  
![The Always Allowed option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/always-allowed-option.jpg)
7. Click the app’s**Home** tab if it’s not selected.
8. Then turn on the**Full Battery Notification** option if it’s disabled. A high battery alert will now pop up when the battery reaches the level set on the**Notification** bar.  
![The Full Battery Notification option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/full-battery-notification-option.jpg)

 You can apply some optional tweaking of the full battery notifier after enabling it. Drag the slider on the**Notification level** bar to set a battery charge percentage level. If you only want the alarm to ring for a fully charged battery, set that bar to 100 percent. Drag the slider left to set the notifier to appear at lower charge levels.

 You can also change the notification’s sound. Click**Default notification sound** to view a list of alarm sounds. To preview a sound, click its play button. Press the**Set audio** option to select an alternative.

 This app also has a handy taskbar indicator for your battery. The app’s taskbar icon shows the percentage level of your batter. Thus, you can keep an eye on the battery level on the taskbar when Battery Notification is open.

## How to Add a Full Battery Charge Alert With Battery Notifier

 Battery Notifier is a small app you can utilize from the Windows 11/10 system tray. This app provides low and high-battery charge notifiers and enables you to view the current battery status by clicking its system tray icon.

5. Right-click**BatteryNotifier.exe** to select**Run as administrator** .

 You can also set custom sounds for the full battery charge notifier. Click the music folder icon below the**Full Battery** bar to view a file selection window. Then choose a music or sound file for the alarm and click**OK** .

 The**Launch at Startup** option there is a self-explanatory setting. That setting [adds the app to the Windows startup](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-add-apps-startup/) when selected. Then you won’t need to manually start the app.

 There are also alternative theme options available. Selecting**Dark** makes the app black. If you prefer a white app, click the**Light** radio button.

## How to Add a Full Battery Charge Alert Full Battery & Theft Alarm

 Alert Full Battery & Theft Alarm is an app with which you add a full battery charge notifier to Windows laptops and Android mobile devices, as it’s available on Google Play. It also provides an additional theft alarm for security. The upgraded version of the app ($1.49) shows your battery history. These are the steps for adding a full battery charge notifier with Full Battery & Theft Alarm.

 To change the sound for the notifier, click the**Reminder Ringtone** drop-down menu; select an alternative alarm or call sound there. Click**Play** to see and hear a test notification with the chosen sound.

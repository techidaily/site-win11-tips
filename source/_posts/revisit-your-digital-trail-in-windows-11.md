## Revisit Your Digital Trail in Windows 11

 Microsoft introduced File History with Windows 8 and even improved the feature to some extent in Windows 10 and 11\. In Windows 10, File History also appeared in the Settings app, but that changed with Windows 11\. The backup feature is missing from the Settings app which is confusing because Microsoft is shifting sections of the Control Panel to Settings.

 But Control Panel isn’t the only way to access File History on Windows. This guide will list eight quick methods to open the File History page in Windows 11\.

## 1\. Using Start Menu

 The most obvious place to search for an app or file on Windows PC is the Start menu. You can even see web results because Microsoft integrated Bing into the Start menu. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press the **Win** key to open the Start menu.
2. Type **File History** in the search box. Click on the first relevant search result to open File History in a new window.

## 2\. Using Control Panel

 File history previously lived in the Settings app in Windows 10 but is now only present in Control Panel's System and Security section. Here's how to access it:

1. Press the Windows key, type **Control Panel** and press the Enter key.
2. In the Control Panel window, click on the **System and Security** option.
3. Scroll down and locate the **File History** option. Double-click on it to view and manage the connected devices and backups.

## 3\. Using the Settings App

 The Settings app doesn't have File History as a separate section but can redirect you to its Control Panel page. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to launch the settings app.
2. Go to the left-hand side section and click on the search bar.
3. Type **File History** and click on the **Restore your files with File History** search result.

## Rectify 'Your Input Cannot Be Opened' Error in Windows, VLC

 Invalid file or folder name, issues with the VLC media player, and issues with YouTube.luac file are the common causes of this error. If you experience this error, here are a few quick fixes to resolve the "your input can’t be opened" VLC error on Windows.

 The "your input can’t be opened" error can occur if the folder path for the saved media is too long. For example, if your file is saved in D:\\Users\\Downloads\\Media\\New\\Files, moving it to a main folder such as**D:\\Users** can fix the issue.

To move the media file to a different folder:

1. Press**Win + E** to open**File Explorer** .
2. Next, navigate to the folder where your media files are saved.
3. Right-click on the media file and select**Copy** .

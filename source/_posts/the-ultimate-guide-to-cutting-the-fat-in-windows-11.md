### Key Takeaways

* Bloatware apps on Windows 11 can include Mail and Calendar, OneNote, Microsoft Teams, Candy Crush, and various third-party apps.
* You can uninstall bloatware manually using Windows 11 Settings or by right-clicking them on the Start Menu.
* Alternatively, use a third-party script like Win11Debloat to automate the removal process, or opt for a Windows 11 clean install to remove most unwanted apps.

 When you buy a new PC—whether a high-end gaming device or an entry-level laptop—you expect it to be clean from the start. However, Windows 11 typically comes with at least a few unwanted pre-installed apps, called bloatware. How should you remove bloatware from your PC?

## What Is Bloatware, and Which Apps Should You Uninstall?

![Windows 11 Start Menu apps](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/windows-11-start-menu-apps.jpg)

 As mentioned, bloatware is a term for apps you don’t want or need, but that come pre-installed on your Windows PC. These could be Microsoft apps the company pushes, like Microsoft Teams or the Mail and Calendar app. Or it could be third-party apps from your device manufacturer—this is especially prevalent among pre-built computers and laptops.

 Common bloatware apps on Windows 11 include OneNote, Microsoft Teams, and Candy Crush. Third-party bloatware apps, like McAfee or Norton antivirus apps, Netflix, and CCleaner, could also come with your PC.

 The apps we mentioned are not necessarily bad for your computer; you may even prefer them over available alternatives. For example, I [use OneNote as my to-do list](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/x-ways-super-charge-list-onenote/) and [switched to Microsoft Edge from Google Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-edge-vs-google-chrome-reasons-to-switch/) in 2021\. Because of this, I didn’t remove those when I bought a new Windows laptop. But if you don’t use the pre-installed apps on your Windows PC, you have the option to uninstall them.

## Uninstall Bloatware Using Windows 11 Settings

 The easiest way to remove bloatware is [through the Windows 11 Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/). As long as you know where to go, uninstalling bloatware (or any app, for that matter) on Windows 11 is quick and simple:

1. Press **Win + I**, or click the **Cog** icon on the Start menu, to open Settings.
2. In the sidebar, click **Apps,** then choose **Installed apps**.  
![Windows 11 Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/windows-11-settings-menu.jpg)
3. Under the **Installed apps** window, find the app you want to remove.
4. Once you’ve found the app you want to remove, click on the **three-dot menu** and choose **Uninstall**.  
![Uninstalling an app using the Windows 11 Settings Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/uninstalling-an-app-using-the-windows-11-settings-menu.jpg)
5. A small pop-up window will appear after you press **Uninstall**; click on **Uninstall** again to confirm your choice.

 With this, you can manually remove pre-installed apps quickly, as the Settings window does not close after uninstalling one app. Note that you cannot remove some apps, like Photos and the Microsoft Store, with this method.

## Remove Pre-Installed Windows 11 Apps From the Start Menu

 Another way to remove unwanted apps is to remove them straight from the Start menu. While tedious if you plan to remove several programs, it's quick if you only need to uninstall one or two apps:

1. Open the **Start** menu and click **All apps** in the upper-right corner.
2. Find the app you want to remove by scrolling the app list or typing its name in the search bar.
3. Right-click on the app and choose **Uninstall**.  
![Uninstall an app from the Windows 11 Start Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/uninstall-an-app-from-the-windows-11-start-menu.jpg)
4. You will then see a pop-up box asking you to confirm app uninstallation; click **Uninstall** once again, and the app will be removed.

 This is great if you notice an app you don’t use while scrolling through the Start menu, as you don’t have to dive into the Settings app to uninstall it.

## Remove Bloatware Using Win11Debloat

 Manually choosing and uninstalling bloatware is easy for those familiar with such apps. However, if you’re unsure which apps to remove or want to automate removing bloatware, the Win11Debloat app will help you:

1. [Download the Win11Debloat script](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat) from GitHub.
2. Go to the folder where you downloaded it and [extract the ZIP file](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-extract-zip-files-windows-11/).
3. After extracting it, open the Win11Debloat folder and double-click the **Run.bat** file.
4. Windows Defender might warn you about running an unrecognized app. If it does so, click **More Info**, then choose **Run anyway**.  
![Windows Protected Your PC pop up](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/windows-protected-your-pc-pop-up.jpg)
5. User Account Control will then ask if you want the app to make changes to your device; choose **Yes** to run it.
6. **Win11Debloat – Setup** will then open in a new Windows PowerShell window. Type either **1** or **2** to choose the method of removing bloatware, then hit **Enter**.  
![Win11Debloat Powershell Setup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/win11debloat-powershell-setup.jpg)
7. Once you’ve chosen, remember to follow the on-screen instructions to run the uninstallation process successfully.

 Win11Debloat is a third-party script that automates the process of clearing up your PC, making it handy if you want to remove several apps or if you’re setting up multiple PCs.

## Try a Clean Install of Windows 11

 If your computer has a particularly bad case of bloatware and you think Win11Debloat won’t work, a Windows 11 clean install will remove most unwanted apps. This is especially true if your computer comes with a ton of third-party apps that your PC’s manufacturer added from the factory.

 A clean Windows 11 installation is an excellent option if you haven’t installed any apps yet or have barely used your PC. But if you’ve already started configuring the system to your liking, this will be inconvenient as you’ll have to reinstall all your desired apps.

 If you’re ready for a Windows 11 clean install, here’s how to do it:

1. Open the Windows Settings app.
2. In the sidebar, click on **System**, then choose **Recovery**.  
![Windows 11 Recovery option in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/windows-11-recovery-option-in-settings.jpg)
3. Click on **Reset PC**.  
![Reset this PC option in Windows settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/reset-this-pc-option.jpg)
4. In the Reset this PC window, choose **Remove everything**.
5. To ensure you get the latest version of Windows, choose **Cloud download** in the next window. If you don’t have a reliable internet connection, pick **Local reinstall** instead.
6. In the **Additional settings** window, click **Change settings** to customize your installation.  
![Reset this PC additional settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/reset-this-pc-additional-settings.jpg)
7. If you have any unwanted apps installed on other drives, ensure that the slider under **Delete files from all drives?** is set to **Yes, all drives**. Be careful though, as this will erase all drives connected to your PC. Don't accidentally erase external drives where you store pictures and the like!  
![Delete files from all drives option in Reset This PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/delete-files-from-all-drives-option-in-reset-this-pc.jpg)
8. Once you’ve confirmed this setting, hit **Next**.
9. When your computer is ready to reset, click **Reset**.  
![Ready to reset this PC window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ready-to-reset-this-pc-window.jpg)

 When you click the reset button, your computer will execute a Windows 11 clean install. This will remove most third-party bloatware, although you’ll still need to remove unwanted Windows apps manually. Alternatively, you can [cleanly install Windows 11 from an ISO](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11/) file to ensure a truly fresh installation.

 Although bloatware isn’t typically dangerous, these apps are annoying as they could slow your PC down, especially if they all launch when you turn your computer on. So by removing these apps—and quickly doing so—you’re reducing your PC’s workload, allowing it to run better.

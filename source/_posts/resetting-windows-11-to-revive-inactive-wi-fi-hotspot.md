## Resetting Windows 11 to Revive Inactive Wi-Fi Hotspot

 A mobile hotspot is a great way to keep your devices connected while you are on the go or when other connections are not available to you. It provides reliable and secure connections to the internet. Although, as with any technology, there can sometimes be issues and you may encounter connectivity problems.

 If you're having trouble getting your Windows device to connect via a mobile hotspot, don't worry - this guide will help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## What Causes My Mobile Hotspot to Stop Working?

 If you find that your mobile hotspot is not working, it could be due to a number of reasons. The most common cause of a non-functioning mobile hotspot is an outdated network adapter driver.

 If the network adapter driver does not have the latest updates, the connection may become unstable or even disconnect unexpectedly. To ensure that your mobile hotspot functions correctly, make sure that all drivers are updated regularly.

## 1\. Troubleshoot Network Adapter

 If you are having mobile hotspot problems in Windows 11, the first step should always be to run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter. This built-in utility can easily identify and resolve a variety of network connection issues that may be causing your mobile hotspot not to work properly.

To access this tool, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. From there, navigate to**System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters** .
3. On the next page, scroll down to**Network Adapter** .
4. Finally, click the**Run** button to begin the process.  
![Run Network Adapter troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/run-network-adapter-troubleshooter.jpg)

 The troubleshooter will scan for any potential issues and then provide some advice on how to resolve them. It may even automatically fix some of these problems if possible, which could potentially save you time over manually trying to diagnose them yourself.

## 2\. Update Your Network Adapter

 When running the Network Adapter Troubleshooter does not resolve the issue, you should then check your Wi-Fi driver. If it's out of date, updating it may solve the problem. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Device Manager** .
2. In Device Manager, expand**Network adapters** .
3. Right-click on your Wi-Fi driver and choose**Update driver** .  
![Update Wi-Fi driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/update-wi-fi-driver.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. On the next screen, select**Search automatically for drivers** .

 After that, wait for the process to finish then restart your computer.

 Sometimes, Device Manager has some issues finding the most recent drivers. If Windows finds nothing and you want a second opinion, check out the[best driver updaters for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/) for some other tools you can try.

## 3\. Modify the Adapter Settings

 Another tactic is to configure the settings of your wireless adapter to ensure that it is working optimally with your mobile hotspot. Here's how to do this:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Settings** . You can also press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the tool directly.
2. Click**Network & internet** on the left panel of Settings.
3. On the right, select**Advanced network settings** .
4. Under Related settings, click**More network adapter options** . This will open the classic Network Connections window.

## 4\. Tweak Registry Editor

 If you're still having problems connecting to your Windows mobile hotspot, it's likely that some changes need to be made to the registry on your computer.

 The Registry Editor contains information about user settings, hardware configurations, software programs, file types, as well as other critical parts of the Windows operating system. Making a tweak to your registry can help fix this issue with the mobile hotspot.

To get started, go through these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box. You can also use one of the other[ways to open Run on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) .
2. Type "regedit" into the text box and hit Enter.
3. In the Registry Editor, go to the following location.  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
4. On the right pane, right-click**HostedNetworkSettings** and select**Delete** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Restart your computer after you have reset the network, and check if the problem has been resolved.

## 6\. Troubleshoot the Problem in a Clean Boot State

 Chances are you have third-party software installed on your computer that interferes with your hotspot. In such a case, you may need to perform a clean boot, leaving only essential services running. In this way, you won't have to worry about non-essential services interfering with your device's normal operation.

1. Press the**Win + R** keyboard shortcut to start the Run program.
2. Type "msconfig" in the dialog box, then press Enter.
3. In the System Configuration window, click the**General** tab.
4. Put a checkmark next to**Selective startup** .
5. Uncheck the**Load startup items** box.  
![Perform-a-Clean-Boot-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Perform-a-Clean-Boot-1.jpg)

1. Go to the**Services** tab now.
2. Select**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** .
3. To save the changes, click the**Apply** button.  
![Hide all Microsoft services](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hide-all-Microsoft-services.jpg)
4. Switch to the**Startup** tab and select**Open Task Manager** .  
![Open Task Manager Via Startup tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Open-Task-Manager-Via-Startup-tab.jpg)
5. On the Startup tab, right-click each service and disable it.
6. Click**OK** when you're done editing System Configuration.

 Once done, check if the mobile hotspot is working properly and then enable one service at a time until it causes the same issue again.

## Ephemeral Approach to Suspending Windows 11 Protection Systems

 Windows Security is the built-in security app for Windows 11\. You should always keep it enabled as it protects your computer from online and offline threats. However, you may come across situations where you might need to disable it.

 Whether you want to disable it for personal preference or install an app that's facing interference by it, here's how to temporarily disable Windows Security in Windows 11.

## 1\. Temporarily Disable Windows Security Using the Settings App

 The Settings app is the central hub of Windows OS, from where you can manage important system settings. You can use it to personalize your computer, change privacy settings, update Windows, and do much more. It's also one of the places to disable Windows Security on your computer. Here's how:

1. Press the**Win + I** hotkeys to open the**Settings** app.

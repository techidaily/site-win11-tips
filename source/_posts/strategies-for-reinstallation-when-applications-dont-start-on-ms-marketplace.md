## 7\. Reinstall the Microsoft Store

 You can reinstall Microsoft Store to fix issues with the app due to corrupt app files or bugs. Since clearing the cache didn’t help, you can perform a reinstall to resolve the error.

 Note that Microsoft Store is a system app. As a result, you cannot uninstall it from the Settings panel. Instead, you’ll need to use the**Get-AppxPackage** cmdlet in PowerShell to remove and reinstall the app.

 Make sure to[create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before uninstalling Microsoft Store. When something goes awry, you can use the restore point to undo the changes and restore your PC to its current state.

To reinstall Microsoft Store:

1. Press the**Win** key and type**powershell** .
2. Right-click on Windows PowerShell and select**Run as administrator.**  
![remove microsoft store powershell](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/remove-microsoft-store-powershell.jpg)
3. Next, in the PowerShell Windows, type the following command and press Enter:  
`get-appxpackage *store |remove-appxpackage`
4. Once the app is removed, use the following command to reinstall Microsoft Store:  
`Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}  

`
5. Wait for the app to install successfully. Then, type**exit** and press**Enter** to close PowerShell.

## Fixing the "This App Couldn’t Be Installed" Error on Windows

 This error is often due to issues with the corrupt app cache and temporary glitches. Use the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter or run the WSreset tool to fix common problems with Microsoft Store. If the issue persists, you can perform a reset or re-register the app to resolve the error.

 That said, if the issue persists with a specific app, you can download the Microsoft Store apps using a third-party service and install them manually on your PC.

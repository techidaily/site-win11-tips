## Remedying Voice Typing Problems (Error Code: 0X80049DD3) in Windows 11

 The voice typing feature in Windows 11 usually enables users to input text (word process) by speaking into their PCs’ microphones. However, some users have reported a 0x80049dd3 voice typing error during 2022\. Those users see this error message when they try to utilize voice typing, “Something went wrong: 0x80049dd3.”

 As a result, users can’t input text with voice typing. Sure, you can always use your keyboard for word processing; but those who need to fix this issue no doubt prefer speech-to-text dictation. This is how you can fix the 0x80049dd Voice Typing error in Windows 11.

## 1\. Run the Recording Audio and Speech Troubleshooters

 Windows 11 includes two troubleshooters that could come in handy for fixing the 0x80049dd3 error. The Recording Audio troubleshooter can resolve sound recording issues.

1. Bring up Windows 11’s Settings app by selecting it in the Start menu.
2. Scroll down the**System** tab and click**Troubleshoot** .
3. Next, click**Other trouble-shooters** to view that part of Settings.

## 4\. Update the Driver for Your Microphone

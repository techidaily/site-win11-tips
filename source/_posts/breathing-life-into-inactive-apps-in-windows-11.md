 Fortunately, it's very easy to troubleshoot the problem. Below are all the working fixes you can try in the situation.

## 1\. Restart and Install Updates

 The best thing you can try to eliminate any Windows issue is to restart the computer. If the problem is caused due to a temporary Windows glitch, it will be fixed with a simple restart.

## 6\. Repair the Mail and Calendar App

 Repairing the app is a textbook trick that is often recommended to troubleshoot any minor issue. We recommend trying this to fix the Mail and Calendar app as well.

Here are the steps to repair the Mail and Calendar app.

1. [Open Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) by using Win + I hotkeys.
2. Click on**Apps** from the left pane.
3. Choose**Apps & features** .
4. Locate Mail and Calendar and click on three dots next to the name.

![Mail and Calendar repair and reset screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Repair-Mail.jpg)

 Windows will take a few seconds to repair the app. Once the process is complete, launch the Mail and Calendar, and check if you are still facing the problem.

## 7\. Clear Microsoft Store Cache

 A corrupt Microsoft Store cache is another cause of a malfunctioning Mail and Calendar app. As such, try clearing the Microsoft Store cache data and see if it fixes the issue.

Here's how to do it.

1. Open**Command Prompt** in administrator mode.
2. Type**wsreset.exe** and press Enter.

 Command Prompt will take a few seconds to execute the command. After that, the Microsoft Store will open automatically.

## 8\. Whitelist Mail and Calendar on Windows Defender Firewall

 Windows Defender Firewall is a built-in Windows tool that makes sure that your system is free from viruses and malware. But at the same time, if Mail and Calendar is blocked under the Firewall settings, you will fail to access the app. You'll have to allow Mail and Calendar through the Firewall to fix the problem.

Here's how to do it.

1. Open Start Menu, type**Windows Security** , and press Enter.
2. Click on**Firewall & network protection** on the left pane.
3. Choose**Allow an app through the firewall** .
4. Click on**Change settings** .

7. Click OK to save the changes.

## 9\. Re-Register the Mail And Calendar App

 Re-registering the Mail and Calendar app is another solution you can try in this situation. This method solves issues that lead to inaccessibility and sudden application crashes.

Here's how to register the Mail and Calendar app.

1. [Open the Windows PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) window by clicking on**Start** and typing "windows powershell" in the search bar.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.  
`Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &ldquo;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&rdquo;}`

 Wait until the command is executed. After that, reboot the system, and check for the problem.

## 10\. Remove Corruption From Your Computer

 The problem can occur due to corrupt system files as well. You can eliminate the issue by running a System File Checker, aka SFC scan.

Here are the steps to run an SFC scan.

1. Open**Command Prompt** in Administrator mode by opening the**Start** menu, typing "command prompt,", right-clicking the search result, and selecting**Run as Administrator.**
2. Type**sfc /scannow** and press Enter.

 Now, check if the problem continues. If yes, try running the DISM scan.

 DISM scans the system for inconsistencies that may result from application failure. You can run DISM by going through the steps below.

1. Open Command Prompt in administrator mode.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.  
`DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth`

Reboot the system once DISM finishes.

## Essential Steps to Java Development Kit Setup in Windows 11

 Java is one of the most favored programming languages for back-end development (apart from JavaScript). Java is also a fairly popular choice for mobile and desktop development.

 Therefore, it makes sense for anyone interested in programming—and the larger software development world in general—to get their hand dirty with Java. In this article, we’ll look at the exact method to install JDK, or the Java Development Environment, a software development environment necessary for running Java on your PC.

## Run a Check for Java JDK on Your PC

 Before we move to the installation, though, it’s useful to see if JDK is already present in your system. To do that, go to the **Start menu** search bar, type in ‘cmd,’ and select the Best match.

 Once you have [opened the Command prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/run-command-prompt-commands-desktop-shortcut/), type the following command and hit **Enter**:

`javac -version`

 As soon as you do that the Command prompt will check your PC for JDK. If your Windows 11 doesn’t have the JDK installed, you should see something like this on your cmd screen:

 Alternatively, you can also check for the JDK through the Control Panel as well. Here's how:

1. Head to **Start menu** search bar, type in 'control panel', and select the best match.
2. Head to **Programs and Features** menu and see if you can find the JDK there.

 If you cannot find the JDK section through either method, jump to the section below for the installation instructions.

## Installing Java JDK in Windows 11

 To install the JDK installer, we need to head to Oracle’s website first. Here’s how:

1. Go to the **Java Downloads** section of the [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows) website, and download the **x64 Installer** from there.
2. As soon as the download completes, launch the installation file and click on **Yes**.
3. The JDK installation wizard will be launched. In the dialog box, click on **Next**.
4. On the next screen, you’ll be asked for the location of your file. Click on **Next**.
5. Once the JDK installation is complete, click on **Close**.

 By the end of this process the Java development kit will be successfully installed on your PC.

## Installing and Running Java in Windows 11

 And that’s all, folks. Follow the steps above, and the Java environment will be successfully set up on your PC. Being one of the more popular programming languages out there, installing and learning Java is your first step in growing in this handy, object-oriented language.

 Therefore, it makes sense for anyone interested in programming—and the larger software development world in general—to get their hand dirty with Java. In this article, we’ll look at the exact method to install JDK, or the Java Development Environment, a software development environment necessary for running Java on your PC.

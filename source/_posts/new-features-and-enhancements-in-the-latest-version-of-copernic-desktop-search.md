## Struggling to Track Down Files on Your Machine? Discover Proven Techniques with Our Guide

Using Copernic to search for files is meant to be easy and intuitive. The steps below outline the process for a basic and simple search.

1. Open Copernic Desktop Search. This will open the main page of Copernic and will look like the image below.
2. Choose the search category by clicking the corresponding category icon. By hovering over the icon, the software will display the search category if needed. If you aren’t sure of the file type, the default search is all files (the computer image in the first position of the category icons). A blank search will display all files that have been indexed.

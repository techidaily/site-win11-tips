## Strategies to Improve Graphics Performance on Hogwarts Learning Platform

 Are you playing Hogwarts Legacy and encountering the "Out of video memory trying to allocate a rendering resource" error? This error usually occurs when your device doesn't meet the game's minimum system requirements. You may also experience this issue if your computer is strained by other resource-intensive processes running simultaneously with the game.

 The error message suggests lowering the game's resolution and closing other applications, but those suggestions don't always work. Therefore, in this article, we'll discuss the fixes that actually resolve the issue.

## Does Your PC Meet the Minimum Requirements for Hogwarts Legacy?

 First, ensure your system has the required hardware to run Hogwarts Legacy. To do that, go to the [Hogwarts Legacy website](https://www.hogwartslegacy.com/en-us/pc-specs) and note the required specs. Then, compare these specifications with those of your computer.

![Check the Hogwarts Legacy System Requirements on Warner Bros Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-1.jpg)

 If your system does not meet the minimum requirements for the game, you should upgrade it.

 If you can't afford this, you can wait for the release of an updated patch that is compatible with your system.

 However, if you already have a system that meets the minimum game requirements, you can begin applying the remaining fixes.

## 6 Ways to Fix the "Out of Video Memory" Error in Hogwarts Legacy

 To fix the "Out of video memory" error in Hogwarts Legacy, you will have to force the game to use your dedicated GPU, update your graphics drivers, increase your dedicated VRAM, close resource-hungry processes, disable GPU overclocking, and adjust the game resolution. Let's see how you apply these fixes.

### 1\. Apply Some Preliminary Fixes

 First off, apply some preliminary fixes, which may resolve the issue quickly:

* Restart Steam or any other client you are using to play the game.
* Close other graphics-hungry processes that are running alongside Hogwarts Legacy.
* Turn off overclocking if you are using your GPU at an overclocked setting.

If the above fixes don't help, proceed to the next fix.

### 2\. Force the Game to Use Your Dedicated GPU

 If you're experiencing the error despite having a GPU with higher specs than required, chances are that Hogwarts Legacy is not using it. Possibly, it's using your integrated GPU, whose specifications aren't that high, thus resulting in the error. Therefore, force the game to always use the dedicated GPU.

 One way to do so is by [forcing the game to use the dedicated GPU from your graphics software](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-default-gpu/) . The process is simple, but there is a catch; Windows sometimes overrides software settings. It is more likely to happen if the power-saving mode is enabled on your device. Therefore, we don't recommend going this route.

 Instead, you can force the game to use your dedicated GPU via Windows settings. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the Windows**Start** button and select**Settings** .
2. Go to the**System** tab on the left.
3. Go to**Graphics** from**Related settings** .  
![Go to the Graphics Settings in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-1.jpg)
4. Click on**Browse** , navigate to the game's installation location, then select its .exe file.
5. Once the game has been added, click**Options** and select**High performance** .  
![Pick the High Performance mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/system-display-graphics-option-high-performance.jpg)

 If you're using Windows 10, follow the steps outlined in our guide on [how to choose the most suitable GPU for apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-choose-preferred-gpu/) .

### 3\. Increase the Dedicated VRAM

 VRAM stands for video RAM, the memory referenced in the error message. If you have a powerful GPU, the game is using it, and you believe that your VRAM is higher than what's required, you should ensure it is properly allocated to the GPU.

 In our guide on [increasing dedicated video RAM on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/video-ram-windows-10/) , we have outlined the steps to check how much video RAM you actually have. If you have enough VRAM available, you should adjust the VRAM allocation in your computer's UEFI or BIOS.

 If the available VRAM isn't sufficient, you can also fake the VRAM increase, which may fix the error under discussion.

### 4\. Optimize the Game Settings

 If increasing the dedicated VRAM wasn't enough to resolve the error, you should optimize the game settings next. To change them, follow the below steps:

1. Open**Settings** by pressing the**Escape** key.
2. Go to the**Display Options** menu, represented by a**cog wheel** on a screen.
3. Lower the**Resolution** and**Rendering Resolution** .
4. Scroll down and turn off the**VSync** option.

 Changing these three settings will make the game work better with the available VRAM resources. If the problem persists, you can optimize other in-game display and graphics settings to get a less pleasing display but smoother performance.

### 5\. Update Your Graphics Driver

 If changing the game settings makes no difference, you should [update your graphics driver on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) . Doing so will allow the game to use GPU resources more efficiently and run more smoothly.

 According to some users on a [Steam community thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/990080/discussions/0/3761104682799019592/) , reinstalling the graphics driver also fixes the issue. If updating the driver doesn't work, uninstall the existing driver, download its fresh copy from your GPU manufacturer's website, and install it.

### 6\. Report the Problem to Warner Bros

 If none of these fixes work, you should report the issue to Warner Bros., the game's publisher. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [official Warner Bros. website](https://hogwartslegacy.bugs.wbgames.com/) .
2. Click on**Report a Bug** in the website's top-right corner.  
![Click on the Report a Bug Button on Warner Bros Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4.jpg)
3. If you are not yet logged in, do so now. If you don't already have an account, create one.
4. After logging in, browse the problems that have already been reported. Most likely, you will see the same error reported by other users. You can also search for it using the search bar. Once you find it, open it and click the**Vote** button.  
![Click on the Vote Button After Finding the Error on Warner Bros Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5.jpg)
5. After that, provide details about your hardware in the comments section.

## Fix the "Out of Video Memory" Error in Hogwarts Legacy

 Getting the "out of video memory" error despite having a powerful GPU can be frustrating. Hopefully, you now have a better understanding of why this error occurs. Also, you should be able to fix the error by tweaking the game or system settings. If your hardware doesn't meet the minimum game requirements, consider upgrading it.

 We have recommended game-specific solutions above, but Windows offers many ways to optimize gaming performance at the OS level. Enabling the Game mode, preventing Steam auto-updates, and disabling Nagle's algorithm are a few ways to boost gaming performance on a Windows device.

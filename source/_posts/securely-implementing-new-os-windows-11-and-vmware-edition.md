## Securely Implementing New OS: Windows 11 & VMWare Edition

 Have you ever tried installing Windows 11 on VMware Workstation Player? It is not as easy as you expect from a Windows OS installation. Microsoft imposed the TPM requirement and secure boot for installing Windows 11\. Fortunately, Oracle introduced TPM virtualization in October 2022 and VMware also caught up sometime later.

 As such, you don’t have to rely on registry hacks to disable the TPM and secure boot requirements while installing Windows 11\. This post will guide you to create a virtual machine and install Windows 11 on it.

## The Prerequisites for Installing Windows 11 on VMware

 Here’s what you will need to install Windows 11 with TPM support in VMware Workstation 17 Player:

1. A Windows 11 ISO image file. Check our detailed guide on[how to download the Windows 11 ISO file](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-iso-direct-download/) .
2. A Windows 10 or above operating system with TPM 2.0 and virtualization support.
3. The latest version of VMware Workstation 17 Player must be pre-installed on the host system.
4. Adequate computing resources to run Windows 11 as a virtual machine. The list includes 64 GB disk space, 4 GB RAM, and a dual-core x64 processor.

 Once you have the necessary ISO file and the latest copy of VMware on your system, you can proceed to the virtual machine creation and Windows 11 installation.

## How to Install Windows 11 in VMware Workstation 17 Player

 Firstly, we will create a virtual machine in VMware for Windows 11\. Then, we will install Windows 11 on the virtual machine. Lastly, we will install VMware tools to finish setting up the virtual machine.

 VMware will display a summary of all the settings you picked for the Windows 11 virtual machine. But there’s one thing still missing: you haven’t customized the hardware preferences or added the Windows 11 ISO file to the virtual machine.

## Run Windows 11 on VMware Without Any Registry Hacks

 With TMP emulation, there is no need for registry tweaking to disable secure boot and TPM requirements on Windows 11\. All the features work fine, and you don’t need to switch to another hypervisor program. However, Oracle VirtualBox offers the same TPM virtualization and secure boot features.

## Secrets of Superior Gaming with AMD Radeon Tweaks

 Do you get low FPS or experience lag while playing games on your computer with Radeon GPU? If yes, then this is the place you need to be.

 In this article, we'll share the best AMD Radeon GPU settings that will help you get the best gaming performance on your computer.

## Making Some Basic Changes in AMD Radeon's Settings

 Before you start changing the AMD Radeon GPU settings, ensure that you have the latest AMD graphics card drivers installed on your computer. To check this, open the AMD Radeon software, and click on the**Gear** icon at the top right corner, followed by**System** .

 In the System window, you'll see the Radeon software version running on your computer. Click the**Check for Updates** option to check for any available driver updates.

 You can also set the**Check For Updates** option to**Automatic** and enable the**Download** **Drivers & Software** option.

 Sometimes, outdated Windows versions are also one of the reasons behind a low frame rate or stuttering issues in the game. The solution, in this case, is to download the latest Windows update.

 To do this, open the Settings menu with**Win + I** , or by using any of the other [methods to open Settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) . Choose**Windows Update** from the left panel, and then click the**Check for Updates** option. Windows will now look for and download any available updates.

 Along with downloading the latest windows and graphics driver update, you must disable the**ULPS (Ultra Low Power State)** in the Registry. To do this, follow the below steps:

 Editing the Registry can be risky, as one wrong move can make your computer unstable. So, make sure to [back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before getting into the below steps.

1. Open the Run dialog box (see [how to open Run on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) ), type**regedit,** and press**Enter** .
2. Click the**Edit** option in the top bar and choose**Find** from the context menu.
3. Check the**Keys** ,**Values** , and**Data** checkboxes.
4. Type**ULPS** in the search bar and press Enter.
5. Right-click the**EnableUlps** key in the right pane and choose**Modify** from the context menu.
6. Type**0** in the**Value data** section and click**OK.**

 Check if there's any improvement in performance. If not, you can enable the ULPS by typing**1** in the EnableUlps Value data section and saving the changes.

## The Most Beneficial AMD Radeon Settings for the Best Gaming Experience

 Now that you've downloaded the latest graphics and Windows update on your computer let's check out the changes you need to make in the AMD Radeon settings.

### 1\. Configure the Global Graphics Settings

 The first thing we should look at is the Global Graphics settings. Tweaking the Global graphics settings will automatically apply the changes to all the games installed on your computer.

 To access the Global Graphics section, open the AMD Radeon software, click the Gear icon, and then switch to the**Graphics** tab.

 The first setting you can enable is the**Radeon Image Sharpening,** which will ensure that you get the best clarity in the game. Usually, this setting works fine for most games, but it can sometimes make things look worse.

 Therefore, you must check the game's performance after enabling this setting. If everything looks fine, then only you should enable this setting permanently.

 The**Sharpness level** is something that will be different for different games. In Battle Royale games like Warzone and Valorant, set the level to around**80-90%** .

 But while playing casual games like Forza or FIFA, keep the sharpness level between**40 to 50%** . Note that the lower the saturation level, the better gaming performance you will get.

 The**Wait for Vertical Refresh** option should be set to**Off unless application specifies** , especially if you're planning to enable the**AMD Radeon Freesync** option. Otherwise, consider setting it to**Always off** .

 Now click the drop-down icon before the**Advanced** option.

 Set the**Anti-Aliasing** and**Anti-Aliasing** option to**Use application settings** and**Multisampling** option, respectively.

 You must reset the Shader cache if you have not in the recent past. To do that, click the**Perform Reset** option next to**Reset Shader Cache,** and click**Yes** to the prompt that appears.

 That's all. These were all the changes you must make in the Graphics tab. Other than the abovementioned changes leave every other option in the Graphics tab to their default values.

### 2\. Change the Display & Video Settings

 The AMD Radeon software offers various display settings that you can configure to get a comparatively better gaming performance. Here are the changes you need to make in the Display tab of the Radeon software.

 To begin with, enable the [AMD FreeSync](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-amd-freesync-and-how-does-it-differ-to-nvidia-g-sync/) option. It dynamically refreshes your screen in sync with the current frame rate of your game. Note that this setting is only applicable to FreeSync-compatible monitors.

 If you're using**Radeon Super-resolution** , you can enable the**GPU scaling** option. Otherwise, keep it to its default setting, i.e.,**Off.**

 You must enable the**Integer Scaling** option, especially if you regularly play 8-bit style titles like Zelda, Pokemon, or Terraria.

 The**Display Color Enhancement** is another personal preference option. You can set it to**Vivid Gaming** if you want better color vibrancy in games.

 Now, enable the**Custom Color** option and apply the following changes:

* **Color Temperature** \- 6500
* **Brightness** \- 6
* **Hue** \- 0
* **Contrast** \- 100
* **Saturation** \- 170 ![Change Color Temperature](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/color-temperature.jpg)

 Next, switch to the**Audio & Video** tab. Here, you can choose the video profile that you prefer. While different profiles offer different viewing experiences, we recommend choosing the**Cinema Classic** option.

### 3\. Adjust Your Preferences ![Preferences Settings of AMD Radeon](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/preferences-settings.jpg)

 As the name suggests, the Preference tab is all about personal preference and will be different for different users. But to get the best gaming performance, we recommend applying the following settings:

* **In-Game Overlay** \- Disabled
* **Web Browser** \- Disabled
* **System Tray** Menu - Enabled
* **Advertisement** \- Disabled
* **Toast Notification** \- Disabled
* **Always On-Top** \- Disabled
* **Animation & Effects** \- Disabled

## Get the Best Windows Gaming Performance With Your Radeon GPU

 The AMD Radeon software is a great utility to optimize your computer's gaming performance. While it has plenty of features, you must not worry about most of them as they work best on their default settings.

 Now that you've customized the AMD Radeon software, why not learn about the important Nvidia control panel settings you must enable to get the best system performance?

## Reclaiming Control over Typing with These 9 Fixes for Broken Keyboard Commands on Windows PC

 Using keyboard shortcuts can improve your productivity as it’s faster to press two or three keys than to search for a feature through a list or menu. You can use keyboard shortcuts for your email accounts, file folders, image editing programs, and more.

 If you can’t use the keyboard shortcuts advantage on your Windows 10 device, we have put together some quick fixes in this guide.

 Let’s start by ensuring that keyboard shortcuts aren’t working because of a hardware problem. Try and use a different keyboard shortcut to make sure it’s not just a [broken key that you should fix](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-keyboard-keys/).

 If you’ve tried multiple keyboard shortcuts and still had no success, use a different USB port and or connect it to a different computer and check if the problem persists.

## 2\. Turn Off the Keyboard’s Gaming Mode

 If you're [using a gaming keyboard](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-tkl-mechanical-keyboards-gaming/), it may automatically disable specific keys, such as the **Windows** key. This way, you can’t accidentally hit a keyboard shortcut while playing.

 Launch the keyboard’s app and turn off any mode that could stop keyboard shortcuts from working.

## 3\. Update Keyboard Drivers

 If you’ve ruled out a hardware issue, let’s move on and try to figure out if there’s something wrong with your software. First, you should ensure that you’re running the latest keyboard drivers available.

 Go to Device Manager and extend the **Keyboards** list. There, right-click the keyboard driver and select **Update driver**.

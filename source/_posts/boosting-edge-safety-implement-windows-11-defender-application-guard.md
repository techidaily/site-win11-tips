 Another method to install Microsoft Defender Application Guard is through the Local Group Policy Editor. This method requires some advanced knowledge and might be challenging for some users but don't worry; if you follow the steps, you'll be okay.

 You'll also find that if you're on Windows Home, the below instructions won't work. This is because it's not enabled by default on Home.

## 4\. How to Install Microsoft Defender Application Guard Using Command Prompt

5. When Command Prompt asks you to restart, type**Y** and hit Enter to complete this operation.

 Once you restart your computer, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be installed and ready to use. In case you want to uninstall the Application Guard, you can do so by using the same command prompt steps. Just make sure to run the following command instead:

`Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:"Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`

`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`
3. Now press**Enter** on your keyboard to execute it.
4. When PowerShell asks you to restart your computer, type**Y** and hit Enter.

 Upon restarting the computer, you will have successfully installed Microsoft Defender Application Guard on your system. Now you can make sure that you are browsing in a secure and protected environment.

 If you ever want to uninstall Microsoft Defender Application Guard, you can do so by using the same PowerShell command. Just make sure to use**Disable** \-WindowsOptionalFeature instead of**Enable** . So, this way the command should look like this:

`Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"​`

 Now press Enter on your keyboard to execute the command and restart your system. Once it is done, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be uninstalled from your PC.

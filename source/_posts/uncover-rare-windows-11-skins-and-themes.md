## 1. macOS Monterey SkinPack

![monterey-skin-pack](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/monterey-skin-pack.jpg)

 Even though Windows 11 already comes with a clean and Mac-like appearance, you can further enhance it by installing a Mac theme. The macOS Monetary SkinPack is great for this purpose, as it changes the entire look of the system.

 Setting it up is quite straightforward, but it is recommended to uninstall any previous skins installed in the system before you install it. A lite version and a full version are available for this skin. The lite version, as the name suggests offers limited functionalities but for a full-blown mac-like look, you will have to pay a small fee of $4.99.

## 2. Windows Nostalgia Bliss

![windows-nostalgia-bliss](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/windows-nostalgia-bliss.jpg)

 There is something calming about the Windows XP Bliss wallpaper, and you can now install the updated version of it on Windows 11\. Once the theme is installed, you can further customize the features as per your requirements.

 It might be a perfect way for users who have been around since the time of Windows XP to relive their past.

## 3. Ubuntu Light SkinPack

![ubuntu-light-skinpack](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ubuntu-light-skinpack.jpg)

 In recent years, Ubuntu has gained prominence due to its safer and more robust system, and installing an Ubuntu theme is a great way to experience the operating system without making a complete switch.

 As the name suggests, Ubuntu Light SkinPack transforms the visuals of your Windows operating system completely, offering new animations, icons, and wallpapers. It also changes the taskbar placement by moving it to the side of the screen.

 However, because of all the new things the theme adds make sure your computer's drivers are updated before you begin installing this theme. And if you'd like help with that, why not try a[free driver updater for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/) to do all the heavy lifting?

 This theme also comes with a paid and free version, just like the macOS Monterey skin.

## 4. Dark Fantasy Landscape

![dark-fantasy-landscape](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dark-fantasy-landscape.jpg)

 If you are into darker themes with an element of thrill and horror (think dark forests with creepy creatures lurking in the background), you might enjoy the Dark Fantasy Landscape theme that comes with 16 HD wallpapers.

 Do not confuse it with the[Windows dark mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-dark-themes/) , which simply makes the overall look black.

## 5. Assassination Classroom

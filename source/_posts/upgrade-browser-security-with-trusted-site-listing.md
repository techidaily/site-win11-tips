## Upgrade Browser Security with Trusted Site Listing

 Whenever you browse the Internet, your browser analyzes each website to ensure it's safe for your computer. However, there might be situations when you wish to access a website despite its security status. If you're wondering how to do this, we're here to assist!

 In this article, we will show how to add trusted sites on Windows 11, plus instructions for various browsers such as Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.

 To use it to add trusted sites to browsers, follow the below instructions:

1. Copy the website URL you want to add to the trusted list.
2. Press the **Windows** key to open the **Start Menu,** type **Internet Options** in the search bar, and press Enter.

 Are you trying to install a new app but running into the “Microsoft Store is blocked” error when launching it? If you’ve already tried the usual fixes such as restarting your computer and closing the app without any luck, give the below fixes a quick try.

## 1\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 As the name implies, you should run this troubleshooter any time you have a problem with one of the Microsoft Store apps. Including the store itself. So, it might be a useful tool while trying to unblock the Microsoft Store app.

1. Right-click the**Start** button and select**Settings** .
2. Click**System > Troubleshoot** and select**Other troubleshooters** .
3. Find**Windows Store Apps** from the list and click the**Run** button next to it.

 Windows will now search for any possible issues with the store apps. Once it finishes the process, it will provide troubleshooting instructions, so make sure to follow them.

## 5\. Check Registry Editor

 If you’re using Windows Home, there’s a chance the Group Policy is missing on your computer. However, you can edit the Registry to unblock the Microsoft Store.

 Launch Registry Editor with administrative rights and head to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Policies > Microsoft > WindowsStore** . Then, in the right pane, delete the**RemoveWindowsStore** value.

 Restart your computer and check if the Microsoft Store is now unblocked.

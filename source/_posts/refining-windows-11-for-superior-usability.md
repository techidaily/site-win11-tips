## Refining Windows 11 for Superior Usability

### Key Takeaways

* Microsoft has increasingly prioritized AI in Windows 11 by frequently adding new Copilot features and integrations.
* Many Copilot features are entertainment-driven rather than addressing lingering issues or meaningfully improving the OS over Windows 10.
* Microsoft should strive for a better balance between Copilot additions and core functional improvements to create the best operating system.

 With new Copilot features being released in quick succession, it's clear what Microsoft is prioritizing with Windows 11 and beyond. Apart from the increasingly diverse ways to interact with AI, you might wonder where the meaningful improvements to Windows 11’s performance, functionality, and overall user experience are.

## Microsoft Makes it Clear: Copilot Is the Future of Windows 11

 When Microsoft released Windows 11 in October 2021, it was called the Windows version for gaming. However, it’s become apparent that [Microsoft’s focus regarding Windows 11 has shifted](https://www.makeuseof.com/future-of-windows-11-ai/) . The company has increasingly prioritized [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.makeuseof.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-simple-terms/) with its continuous stream of Copilot integrations.

 In December 2023, Executive Vice President and Consumer Chief Marketing Officer [Yusuf Mehdi mentioned](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/12/05/celebrating-the-first-year-of-copilot-with-significant-new-innovations/) Microsoft's commitment “to bringing more innovation and advanced capabilities to Copilot” in 2024.

 The fruits of this commitment are now being realized in Windows 11, as several AI-powered features, updates, and improvements have been announced and released.[A Copilot key is even available on some newer Windows 11 PC keyboards](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsofts-copilot-key-windows-11-pc/) , making the AI assistant more accessible. Furthermore, in April 2024, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer [Judson Althoff announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/04/24/leading-in-the-era-of-ai-how-microsofts-platform-differentiation-and-copilot-empowerment-are-driving-ai-transformation/) Microsoft's goal of a “Copilot on every desk, every device and across every role.”

 It’s clear that Copilot and AI, not gaming, have become central to realizing Windows 11's full potential and Microsoft's broader ambitions.

## Where Are the Real Features?

 Microsoft’s Copilot features, while cool and awesome, sometimes feel more like fun additions than substantial improvements to Windows 11\. For instance, the ability to make video chats look like paintings or [create images with Copilot](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-use-bing-image-creator-free/) might be entertaining, but it doesn’t necessarily address the usability of Windows 11.

 When I had the “Standard hardware security not supported” Windows Security error, Microsoft took a while to address this bug. In the meantime, the company released new Copilot features, including the seemingly unnecessary [Copilot + Notepad integration](https://www.makeuseof.com/supercharge-notepad-copilot/) . Releasing cool AI features, no matter how advanced, before addressing lingering issues reveals concerning priorities.

 Where are the features that improve the functionality of Windows 11 over Windows 10? For most of us, everyday productivity does not revolve around Notepad, Paint, Snipping Tool, and Clipchamp. One of [Copilot's best uses would be automating troubleshooting](https://www.makeuseof.com/copilot-fix-problems-in-windows/) , but unfortunately, it can't do that yet.

 Windows 10 set a high standard by delivering real features; for instance, Device Guard strengthened protection while Continuum and Hello modernized interaction methods. Most of Windows 11's changes have revolved around redesigns or AI-fueled capabilities in areas like image generation, content creation, and automation. While amazing demonstrations of technological progress, they don’t really improve the essential day-to-day functionality of the operating system.

 Lingering issues like an inconsistent UI, wonky taskbar, sluggish file explorer, and compatibility headaches leave many of us questioning whether it truly serves as an upgrade over Windows 10\. Several users have even claimed that W11 lags behind W10 in responsiveness, particularly on older hardware.

## Slow Steps in the Right Direction

 Despite my criticism, it's only fair to acknowledge that Microsoft has also made moves in the right direction. Additions like the revamped Snipping Tool and an upgraded Snap feature for easier multitasking offer real utility. The Windows 11 interface is also starting to provide a welcome coherence compared to past releases.

 Similarly, it’s easier and better to work with multiple monitors on W11 than on W10\. The new and improved Widgets feature, integration of Teams, and Focus mode are also welcome Windows 11 additions. These features represent the type of functional updates we want to see prioritized over fun AI features.

 Admittedly, Copliot has huge potential, and should only get more capable as [AI PCs become more common](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ai-pc/) . Eventually, the AI assistant should meaningfully augment Windows 11's core functionality.

 Copilot's integration into apps and browsers on your W11 PC could save you valuable time, allowing you to focus on important tasks. The issue is when the balance is tipped in favor of fun Copilot features over functional features. As Microsoft continues to improve Windows 11, we can only hope that they will strive to create an operating system that is not just more fun but also better.

## 2\. Using a REG File

 If you're [unable to open the System Settings window or if it isn't working](https://www.makeuseof.com/fixes-unable-to-open-windows-settings/), use a reg file instead. A reg file is a registry key file that helps you tweak Windows settings.

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\gaming]  
"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000

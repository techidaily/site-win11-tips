## Overcome Xbox Stranded Message: Quick Solution for Windows Users

 Some Xbox app users have reported a “Looks like you’re stranded” error on support forums. Those users see that error message when trying to log in to the Windows Xbox app or utilize certain features in it. That error message also says, “The app isn’t responding” and suggests restarting.

 Users can’t utilize the Windows Xbox app when this error keeps reoccurring. Does the same thing happen when you try to utilize the Xbox app on Windows? If it does, this is how you can fix the Xbox app’s “Looks like you’re stranded” error in Windows 10 and 11\.

## 1\. First, Check the Status of Xbox Servers

 The “Looks like you’re stranded” error can sometimes be the result of server-side issues or maintenance. So, check the status of Xbox servers to see if there are any issues there before you start troubleshooting. To do that, open this [Xbox status page](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) that shows you the status for Xbox features and services.

 Click the **Account & profile** and **Apps & mobile** sections on that page to view status details for those categories. Does that page show limited or outage indicators for any services? If so, wait a few days for such server-side issues to be sorted.

## 2\. Utilize the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 The Windows Store Apps troubleshooter could be a useful tool for fixing the “Looks like you’re stranded” error. This is how you can utilize the Windows Store App troubleshooter:

1. Press **Start** and click on the **Settings** app’s shortcut.
2. Click **System** \> **Troubleshoot** to view three alternative navigation options.
3. Select the navigation option labeled **Other trouble-shooters**.
4. Click **Run** for the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.

5. Then apply potential resolutions proposed within the troubleshooter.

 The same troubleshooter is available in Windows 10, but that platform’s Settings app has a slightly different layout. You can access it in Windows 10’s Settings app by selecting **Update & Security** \> **Troubleshoot** \> **Additional troubleshooters**. Then click on Windows Store Apps to access a **Run the troubleshooter** option.

## 3\. Reinstall Your Xbox App

 Finally, reinstall your Xbox app if nothing else works for fixing the “Looks like you’re stranded” error. You can do that by removing Xbox with the Settings method in our [guide to uninstalling Windows software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/). Then open the [Xbox Microsoft Store page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox/9MV0B5HZVK9Z) and click **Get in Store app** \> **Open Microsoft Store**. Select **Get** within the Microsoft Store window to reinstall the latest Xbox app on your PC.

## 4\. Try Some Generic Windows App Fixes

### Change Your DNS Server to Google's Public DNS

 Our [guide to changing DNS servers in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-alternate-ways-change-dns-server-settings/) tells you how to apply this possible resolution and includes the primary and alternative DNS addresses for Google.

## How to Handle Error Code: 0X80 Point-to-Point Link Failure on Windows

 The network error 0x800704b3 occurs when you attempt to connect to the internet or a network resource. This code is also associated with a message that states "The network path was either typed incorrectly, does not exist, or the network provider is not currently available. Please try retyping the path or contact your network administrator."

 Below, we discuss the different solutions that you can try to fix this problem for good.

## 1\. Run the Network Troubleshooter

 If you encounter a network error, the first thing you should try is running the network troubleshooter. It's a handy tool built into Windows that can quickly scan your network settings, detect common network issues, and even apply automatic fixes.

 In case the troubleshooter can't resolve the problem automatically, it may offer suggestions for manual fixes that you can try out.

 Here is how to proceed:

1. Press the **Win** \+ **I** keys together to open the Settings app.
2. Choose **System** \> **Troubleshoot**.
3. Click on **Other troubleshooters**.

4. In the following window, look for the Network troubleshooter and click on the **Run** button for it. The troubleshooter will now start scanning the system for potential errors. If it finds anything, it will notify you.

5. Once the scan completes, check the results. If the troubleshooter has suggested fixes, click on **Apply this fix**.
6. Otherwise, choose **Close the troubleshooter** and move to the next method below.

## 2\. Enable the Related Services

 There are a few vital Windows services that play a crucial role in ensuring proper network connectivity. These services are responsible for establishing and maintaining network connections. However, if any of these services become corrupt or malfunction, it can lead to the network error you are experiencing.

 Here is how you can ensure the required services are running:

1. Press the **Win** \+ **R** keys together to open Run.
2. Type "services.msc" in Run and click **Enter**.
3. In the following window, locate the DHCP Client service and right-click on it.
4. Choose **Properties** from the context menu.

5. Click on the **Start** button for it if the service was not running already. If it was, click **Stop**, wait for a few seconds, and click **Start** again.
6. Ensure the Startup type is set to **Automatic**.

7. Click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes.

 Perform the same steps for these services:

* DNS Client
* Network Connections
* Network List Service
* Network Location Awareness
* TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper
* WLAN AutoConfig (if using Wi-Fi)

 Once all the services are running, close the Services window and check if the problem has been resolved. While you are at it, you can also try to [update your network drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-replace-outdated-windows-drivers/) as in some cases, outdated or corrupt drivers can prevent the system from establishing successful connections, leading to issues like the one at hand.

## 3\. Disable and Re-enable Network Adapter

 You can also try to reset your network connection to fix the problem. This will resolve temporary glitches or conflicts that might be causing the network error.

 Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Right-click on the network icon in the corner of the taskbar. It typically is in the form of a computer monitor or a Wi-Fi signal indicator.
2. Choose **Open Network & Internet settings** from the context menu. This will launch the Network & Internet settings window.
3. Navigate to **Advanced network settings** \> **More network adapter options**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Wait for a few before right-clicking on it again and choosing **Enable**.
6. Once done, close the Settings window and try to perform the action that was initially triggering the error.

 If the problem was being caused by issues with the adapter, this should fix them.

## 4\. Disable SMB 1.0 Protocol

 The SMB (Server Message Block) protocol allows file and printer sharing between the different devices on a network. The SMB 1.0 is an older version of the protocol and can lead to different issues due to some known vulnerabilities as well as incompatibility.

 Disabling it can help you prevent any potential conflicts or compatibility issues that might be arising from this protocol and leading to the error.

 Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Press the **Win** \+ **S** keys together to open the Search utility.
2. Type Windows Features and click on **Open** for "Turn Windows features on and off".
3. In the following dialog, locate SMB 1.0 and uncheck the box associated with it.
4. If a confirmation prompt pops up, click **Yes**.

5. Click **OK** to save the changes and restart your computer. Upon reboot, check if the issue is resolved.

## 5\. Reset TCP/IP Stack

 The TCP/IP stack is a set of protocols that enable and allow network communication on your computer. There are times when the TCP/IP settings can become corrupt or are simply misconfigured, which leads to issues like the one at hand.

 To fix problems with the TCP/IP stack, you can reset it. This will revert it to its default, error-free state, hopefully resolving the network issue in the process.

 Here is how you can do it:

1. Open Run by pressing **Win** \+ **R** keys together.
2. Type "cmd" in Run and press the **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ Enter keys together to open Command Prompt as administrator.
3. Click **Yes** in the User Account Control prompt.
4. In Command Prompt, type the following command and click **Enter** to execute it. This will reset Winsock Catalog.  
`netsh winsock reset`
5. Now, execute this command to reset the TCP/IP stack.  
`​​​​​​​netsh int ip reset`
6. Finally, restart your computer to apply the changes.

 If the error persists, you can try repairing the system files and Windows image using the SFC and DISM utilities. Our [comprehensive guide on using the built-in Windows troubleshooting tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) discusses this in detail.

## Network Errors Resolved

 Network errors can be frustrating, especially if you need to access the internet urgently. Hopefully, the fixes we have listed above will help you fix the error at hand once and for all. If it reappears, you can contact the official Microsoft support team with the essential information and report the issue to them.

 Below, we discuss the different solutions that you can try to fix this problem for good.

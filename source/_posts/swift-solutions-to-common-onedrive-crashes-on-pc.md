## 1\. Check OneDriver Servers

 As the error message says, there might be something wrong with OneDrive servers and Microsoft is currently fixing them or doing some maintenance work. You can check the[OneDrive server status](https://portal.office.com/servicestatus) so you can figure out if the problem is limited to your device or network.

 If Microsoft has indeed reported an issue regarding the OneDrive servers, there’s nothing you can do but wait. Otherwise, it's time to troubleshoot on your end..

## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 A slow or unstable internet connection might be the reason why OneDrive displays the “Sorry, there is a problem with the OneDrive servers” error. If you have a faulty internet connection, OneDrive will have a hard time connecting to the server and synchronizing your data.

 If OneDrive isn’t the only app malfunctioning due to an improper connection, you should[fix your unstable internet connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-slow-unstable-wi-fi-connection/) .

## 3\. Delete OneDrive Cache

 Like any other app on your computer, OneDrive stores and uses cache, so it doesn’t download the same data every time. But if the cache gets corrupted, you’ll run into all sorts of issues, including the server error.

 To remove the OneDrive cache, launch a Run dialog by pressing**Win + R** . Then, type**wsreset.exe** and press**Enter** .

## 4\. Check Firewall Settings

 If you can access OneDrive on the web but get the server error when launching the app, take a quick look at your firewall settings.

 Windows firewall might affect OneDrive functionality so make sure to[allow the app through the Windows firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) . Similarly, if you have installed a third-party antivirus, you should add OneDrive to the exception list.

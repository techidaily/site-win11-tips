## Real-Time Bandwidth Visualization for Users

 Do you want to monitor how your internet speed fluctuates over time? Displaying upload and download speeds on the taskbar is an easy way to track your internet quality. Unfortunately, Windows does not offer a native way to display internet speed on the taskbar, but we can use third-party apps instead.

 Below, we'll show you how to display internet speed on your taskbar using TrafficMonitor, one of many tools available for this purpose.

## How to Display Internet Speed on the Taskbar on Windows

 To display internet speed on your taskbar on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Go to [MajorGeek's official website](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/trafficmonitor.html) to download TrafficMonitor.
2. Extract the downloaded folder (check out [different ways to extract ZIP files on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-extract-zip-files-windows-11/)), and you'll see an executable file for running the tool, so you don't have to install the tool.
3. Click the **Yes** button in the **UAC** window.
4. Initially, the app's main window will display your internet's download and upload speed.
5. To display these numbers on your taskbar, right-click on the tool's main window and select **Show Taskbar Window**.

6. Once the internet speed appears on the taskbar, right-click the main or taskbar window and uncheck **Show Main Window**. This will hide the main window of the tool.

 That's how TrafficMonitor displays internet speed on the taskbar. The tool lets you choose the network connection you want to monitor and change the display's font, font size, background color, and display unit, among other options. Depending on your preferences, you can change the display settings in the **Option Settings** window.

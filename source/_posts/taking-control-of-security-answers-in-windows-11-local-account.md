## 1\. Using Group Policy Editor

 To disable local account security questions on your computer, use the Group Policy Editor. However, this method applies only to Pro and Enterprise editions. See our guide on [how to access the Local Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the text box and hit Enter. The Local Group Policy Editor will then appear.
3. From the left-side navigation pane, expand to the following path:  
`Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Credential User Interface`
4. On the right-side panel, double-click on the **Prevent the use of security questions for local accounts** policy.

## 3\. Using a Reg File

 If you don’t want to edit the registry manually, create a Reg file instead. This is a simple and quick way to disable local account security questions on Windows. It's especially useful for users without Group Policy Editor access or who prefer not to use Registry Editor.

1. Open Notepad (see [how to open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) for methods).
2. Copy and paste the following code into it:  
`<code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System]  
"NoLocalPasswordResetQuestions"=-`
3. Click on **File** \> **Save as**.
4. Select **All Files** from the **Save as type** drop-down menu.

5. Name the file **DisableSecurityQuestions.reg** and save it to your desktop.
6. Now double-click on the reg file to execute it.

 This will create a new registry value in the System key and immediately disable local account security questions in Windows 11\. To enable the feature again, delete the **DisableSecurityQuestions.reg** file from your desktop and restart the computer.

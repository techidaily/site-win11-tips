## Dial Up Decibels: The Top 4 Programs to Increase Volume on Windows

 Is the sound coming out of your audio output device too low despite turning up the volume and twisting the speaker knob all the way to the maximum setting? If so, either the audio file quality is poor, the audio was recorded improperly, or some other factor has hampered the audio frequency.

 One way to fix the low audio problem is to use an audio booster app, which amplifies the sound and makes it sound much louder and clearer than the original. Below, we'll discuss how to boost your sound volume beyond 100 percent with the best audio booster apps for Windows.

## 1\. Letasoft Sound Booster

 Sound Booster by Letasoft is a popular sound booster app because it is lightweight, easy to set up, and has an easy-to-use interface. The app allows you to increase the volume by up to 500%, nearly five times that of the default setting. In addition, you can change the interface language, set hotkeys to adjust the sound level, and use different modes to improve sound quality.

 To install and use Letasoft Sound Booster on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Letasoft's official website](https://www.letasoft.com/sound-booster-download/) and download the app.
2. Once the app has been downloaded, run the setup file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.
3. Once the installation completes, search for **"Letasoft Sound Booster"** in Windows Search and open the app. Rather than opening an interface, the app will be added to the system tray, from where you can customize or use it.
4. Go to the **system tray** and click the **black speaker icon** to open the app.

5. Drag the **slider** upward to increase the sound level beyond 100 percent.

 To switch between boost modes, such as injection, injection with APO effect, APO effect, and super boost, right-click the app icon in the system tray, go to **Boost Mode**, and select your desired mode.

 In the **Settings** menu, you can set up hotkeys and customize the other app settings.

**Download:**[Letasoft Sound Booster](https://www.letasoft.com/sound-booster-download/) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 2\. Sound Booster

 When it comes to boosting the volume of the content being played in your browser, the Sound Booster extension should be your first choice. The app lets you increase the sound volume of current tabs up to 600 percent, almost six times higher than the default.

 The extension is available for free on the Chrome web store, which means you can use it at no cost on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. If you use a different browser, look for a similar sound booster extension available in that browser to bump up the volume beyond 100 percent.

 To install and use the Sound Booster extension, follow the below steps:

1. Go to the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sound-booster-increase-vo/nmigaijibiabddkkmjhlehchpmgbokfj/related) and click **Add to Chrome** or **Get** on Microsoft Edge to add the extension.  
![Add Sound Booster Extension in Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-add-sound-booster-extension-in-chrome.jpg)
2. Once added, click on the **extension** in the browser to open its interface.
3. Turn on the toggle in the top-right corner to activate the extension.
4. Drag the slider from 100 percent to the level of your choice.

## 3\. Boom 3D

 The Boom 3D interface is relatively complicated but has many features designed to boost the volume and enhance the audio quality. The app lets you increase or decrease the pitch of your voice, enable and adjust effects such as fidelity, spatial, and ambiance, and turn on the night mode.

 Besides that, Boom 3D lets you adjust the volume of different apps, drag and drop audio files to play within the app, and use preset equalizers to enhance the audio quality or boost the volume level. You can also create a custom equalizer to meet your specific needs and save the equalizer settings for future use.

 Go to the [Microsoft Store Boom 3D page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/boom-3d-audio-enhancer-equalizer-and-3d-audio/9PP81H1NCZS1?hl=en-pk&gl=pk&rtc=1) and download the app. Once downloaded, open the app, click the **arrow button** beside the volume slider, and choose the audio output device you use. Likewise, enable the available effects and adjust their level to improve the audio quality.

 To use an equalizer, click the drop-down menu next to **Equalizer** and select one from the presets available. Each preset is tailored to a specific style, and you can drag the dozens of sliders to boost volume or enhance quality. To turn the equalizer on or off, click the **circular icon** beside it.

![Enable or Disable Equalizer by Clicking the Circular Icon Beside It in the Boom 3D App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/8-enable-or-disable-equalizer-by-clicking-the-circular-icon-beside-it-in-the-boom-3d-app.jpg)

## 1\. Disregarding the Power of Tabs in File Explorer

![Windows 11 File Explorer with so many tabs open and scroll arrow buttons showing](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/file-explorer-title-bar-scroll-buttons.jpg)

 If you're running Windows 11, version 22H2 with Moment 3 update, you can open multiple tabs in File Explorer, just like in a web browser. When you don't use the feature, you have multiple folders that are opened in multiple windows, making switching between folders inconvenient.

 There are more benefits to using tabs. Right-clicking on tabs will display options to **Close other tabs**, which closes all tabs except the one you're currently seeing.

 Tabs can save you time, as you don't have to click multiple times to close multiple windows. You can learn [how to use tabs in File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-file-explorer-tab-guide/) to become more productive on Windows 11\.

## 2\. Neglecting Keyboard Shortcuts

![two people using a windows laptop](https://thmb.techidaily.com/44b8e2a77a17fe4113b1c8cef6e112b2db098718a055c6f3927bcc9e40cc66cb.jpg)

 From opening the File Explorer to creating folders, keyboard shortcuts can help you work faster, which otherwise would've taken longer. [Keyboard shortcuts in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-keyboard-shortcuts/) are also the only solution when your trackpad or mouse is not working. And if you're facing the same issue, you should learn [how to fix your laptop's trackpad](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-laptop-touchpad-not-working/).

 As for keyboard shortcuts in File Explorer, there are plenty of useful ones. You can even use them to open tabs and make the folder icons bigger or smaller. Here is a list of some of the important keyboard shortcuts you can use in Windows 11's File Explorer:

* Press **Ctrl** \+ **N** to open a new window.
* Press **Ctrl** \+ **W** to close the current window.
* Press **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ **N** to create a new folder.
* Press **Alt** \+ **P** to display the preview pane.
* Press **Alt** \+ **Enter** to open the properties of the selected file.

## 3\. Avoiding Recent and Favorites Sections

 File Explorer shows you recent files or folders you've opened, making them easier for you to quickly jump on later if needed. You shouldn't make the mistake of going to the folder location again to find something if you opened it recently. Instead, check the **Recent** section of File Explorer and get quick access to all the files you've opened recently.

 Moreover, you should also mark important files as favorites. File Explorer has a **Favorites** section where it lists everything you labeled as a favorite. By avoiding the **Favorites** section, you could spend more time finding that important file whenever needed. Both **Recent** and **Favorites** items are displayed on the File Explorer Home Page.

 Although, marking something as a favorite and the recent section in File Explorer may breach your privacy. If you're sharing your computer with someone but don't want to let that person know about your recent activities in File Explorer, you should always remove everything from the **Recent** section. You should clean the **Favorite** section before handing over your laptop.

 If you're a privacy-minded user, you should know [how to adjust various control options to protect your privacy](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-privacy-options-explained/) in Windows 11\.

## 4\. Not Using Search Syntax While Searching Something in File Explorer

 If you type something in the File Explorer search box, it will show you a complete list of files containing what you typed. Many of us spend more time finding the one on that long list.

 You should avoid this common mistake to work more efficiently on Windows. Instead, you need to use what's called "search syntax" in File Explorer to find the exact item you're looking for.

 If you type "name:" followed by the file's name, it will only display the exact file you typed. You can also use "kind," "size," and "date." as syntax, too. For example, typing "size: 84 KB" in the File Explorer search box will display only a list of files that are of that size.

 If you aren't aware of checkboxes in File Explorer, you'll commit the mistake of selecting multiple files using both the keyboard and mouse.

 Checkboxes appear right before the file name, and you can check those boxes to select files and perform several actions, including moving, deleting, copying, renaming, and more.

 You can check out how to [enable checkboxes in File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-checkboxes-select-files-windows-11/) to select multiple items more easily. This is the easiest way to select multiple files using your mouse or trackpad.

 One of the reasons you're facing challenges in finding files or folders could be that you aren't naming them properly. And if you have many of them, it can get messy.

 Windows is known for its customizations. You also get a ton of options in File Explorer that enable you to give it a unique touch and be more productive. You're not utilizing some of the handy File Explorer features if you're not customizing it.

 One of the most widely used customization options is changing how folders and files are displayed in File Explorer. You can view files and folders with different view options, including tiles, lists, icons, content, and more. You can also [hide or reveal files containing sensitive information](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-quick-easy-ways-hide-folder-windows-7/) at your convenience from File Explorer.

## Win11 Edge Removal Made Simple

 Although Microsoft Edge has made significant progress in recent years, it still lags far behind its biggest rival—Google Chrome. If you’re someone who does not like using Microsoft Edge, you may want to get rid of the browser entirely.

 It’s no secret that Microsoft wants users to use its own browser on Windows 11\. To that end, the company has made it difficult to remove the browser from Windows 11\. However, it’s still possible to do so. Here we'll show you three different ways to uninstall Microsoft Edge from your Windows 11 PC.

## 1\. How to Uninstall Microsoft Edge Using the Command Prompt

 You can uninstall Microsoft Edge from your PC by running a few commands in the command prompt. The process requires you to know the version number of Microsoft Edge on your computer. Once you have that, you can get rid of the browser.

Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Open Microsoft Edge on your PC.
2. Click the**three-dot menu icon** in the top right corner and select**Help and feedback > About Microsoft Edge** .
3. Copy Microsoft Edge's version number from the**About** section.

4. Press**Win + X** and select**Terminal (Admin)** from the menu that appears.
5. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt shows up.
6. In the console, run the following commands to navigate to the directory where Microsoft Edge is installed:  
`cd/  
cd %Program Files (x86)%\Microsoft\Edge\Application\EdgeVersion\Installer`  
 Replace**EdgeVersion** in the above command with the actual version number noted earlier.
7. Paste the following command and press**Enter** to uninstall Microsoft Edge.  
`setup --uninstall --force-uninstall --system-level`

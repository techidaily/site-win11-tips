## Boosting Android Studio Speed on Windows PCs

 Android Studio is the most popular software for Android app development. It allows developers to write code, test, and debug their apps, as well as build and deploy them.

 Android Studio, being feature-rich, requires a lot of system resources to run. As a result, for those who do not have a powerful computer, Android Studio may be difficult to use and take a long time to build (create the final APK file).

 If youâ€™re one of them, keep reading to learn some helpful tips for optimizing your Android Studio experience on a low-end computer.

## 1\. Increase Memory Allocation for Android Studio

 Memory allocation means assigning a specific amount of memory, or RAM, to Android Studio in order to improve its efficiency. By default, Android Studio is allowed to use up to 1.28GB of RAM, but if your computer has more RAM available, you can increase this amount.

 Follow these steps to increase the memory allocation for Android Studio:

1. Open Android Studio and go to**File > Settings** .
2. From the left-hand side menu, select **Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Memory Settings** .  
![Memory Settings In Android Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-memory-settings.jpg)
3. Increase the**IDE max heap size** to at least**2048MB** or**4096MB** , depending on whether your computer has 4GB or 6GB of RAM, respectively.  
![IDE Heap Size In Android Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-ide-heap-size.jpg)
4. Click**Apply** and then**OK** to save the changes.
5. Restart Android Studio for the changes to take effect.

 The amount of RAM to allocate is a personal decision that depends on your computer's specifications. If you're unsure how much RAM your computer has, check [how to determine hardware specifications](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-pc-specs/) for help.

## 2\. Update Android Studio

 If you're using an older version of Android Studio, you should consider updating to take advantage of the most recent features and bug fixes.

 Follow the below-given steps to update Android Studio to the latest version:

1. Launch Android Studio and navigate to the**Help** tab, then select**Check for Updates** .  
![Help Tab Options In Android Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-help-tab-options.jpg)
2. A dialogue box will appear, prompting you to either**Update** or ignore the available updates.
3. Choose**Update > Update and Restart** .

 You can also update Gradle and the SDK tools along with Android Studio for the best performance.

 Gradle is a powerful build system for Android Studio that automates tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your Android app. Your build processes will be faster, smoother, and more reliable if you use the latest version of Gradle.

## 3\. Install Android Studio on an SSD

 SSDs are ideal for use with Android Studio because they provide faster read and write speeds, allowing for faster access to stored data. We have already explained the [benefits of using an SSD](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ssd-storage/) in detail.

 If you install Android Studio on an SSD rather than an HDD, you'll benefit from shorter loading and build times, faster Gradle sync, and improved overall performance.

 To install Android Studio on an SSD, you just need to change the installation location while [setting up Android Studio on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-android-studio-setup/) for the first time. When prompted to select a location, choose your SSD using the**Browse** option in the**Configuration Settings** . If you have already installed Android Studio, you can move the installation folder (usually located at**C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio**) to your SSD.

![Android Studio Installer Overview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-installer.jpg)

 Installing Android Studio on an SSD will provide a noticeable boost in performance, making it easier and faster to develop your apps.

## 4\. Disable Unnecessary Plugins in Android Studio

 Unnecessary plugins in Android Studio are those applications and features that you're not actively using but that are still taking up resources on your system. By disabling such unnecessary plugins, you can improve Android Studio's performance significantly.

Here's how to disable unnecessary plugins in Android Studio:

1. Open Android Studio and go to**File > Settings** or press**Ctrl + Alt + S** .
2. Select**Plugins** from the left-side navigation pane.  
![Plugin Menu In Android Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-plugin-menu.jpg)
3. Uncheck the boxes next to the plugins you wish to disable and click**Disable** and then**OK** .  
![Installed Plugins List In Android Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-installed-plugins-list.jpg)
4. Click**File > Restart IDE** for the changes to take effect.

 After you complete these steps, the plugins you disabled will no longer work and will not appear in the menus or be accessible within Android Studio.

## 5\. Configure Lint in Android Studio

 Lint is a static code analysis tool in Android Studio that helps detect potential errors and performance issues in your code.

 To ensure a smooth coding experience in Android Studio, you can configure Lint to identify any performance issues caused by inefficient code or poor coding practices.

Follow the below steps to configure Lint in Android Studio:

1. Press**Ctrl + Alt + S** to open Android Studio's settings.
2. Click**Editor > Inspections** , and then check the box for**Android Lint** or**Lint** . If you're unable to find it, use the search box and type**Android Lint** in it.  
![Lint Settings In Android Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-lint-settings.jpg)
3. Click the**Apply** button, and then**OK** to save the changes.

 In addition to configuring Lint for all your projects, you can also enable or disable specific Lint checks as well as configure the severity level for each check. To view suggestions for your current project, go to the**Project** window and click**Code > Inspect Code** .

 You can also configure the scope of the lint checks, such as whether to check only the current file or the entire project. This can help decrease build time and generate your APK file much faster in Android Studio.

## 6\. Update the GPU driver

 In layman's terms, a GPU driver is a software package that helps an operating system utilize a graphics card to render graphics.

 If you run Android Studio using an updated GPU, you will be able to enjoy a better and smoother development experience. This is because Android Studio will shift the heavy work of UI rendering to the GPU, while the CPU handles processes like compiling, project building, etc.

 Now that you know the importance of the GPU, check out [how to update the GPU drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) for help.

 If you want to go further, check out [ways to boost Windows' performance](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-faster-performance/) for more tricks.

## 7\. Add Android Studio to the Graphics Performance Preference

 Graphics Performance Preferences is a Windows feature that allows you to choose which software you want to give permission to use a high-performance GPU or GPU to save power and improve performance.

 Follow the below steps to add Android Studio to Graphics Performance Preference:

1. Open the**Settings** app by pressing**Win + I** , and then click on**System** .
2. Select the**Display** option, and then select the**Graphics settings** option in the right pane.
3. Click on the**Browse** button, navigate to the folder containing Android Studio, i.e.,**C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\bin** , and double-click on the**studio-64.exe** file.  
![Android Studio Files Overview In File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-files-overview.jpg)
4. Select**Android Studio > Options > High Performance** , and then click**Save** to add it to the Graphics Performance Preference list.  
![Android Studio Graphics Settings On Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/android-studio-graphics-settings.jpg)

 Additionally, you can also enable**Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** in order to improve the performance of Android Studio.

## Mastering the Art of Running High-Privilege PowerShell on W11 PCs

 PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET technology. It's designed especially for system administrators and power users, so it has more features than the standard Command Prompt. If you want to use PowerShell to do anything more than basic tasks, you must run it as an administrator.

 In this guide, we'll show you ten simple ways to open an elevated PowerShell prompt on Windows 11.

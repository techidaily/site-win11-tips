![mp4splitter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mp4splitter.jpg)

 MP4Tools is a collection of two tools—a splitter and a joiner—that complement each other to help you split or join your videos as required. For your video-cutting requirements, you will use the MP4Splitter app. The app is open-source and can help you break multiple files without re-encoding or losing quality data.

 Moreover, you’ll see a play button when you upload a video on the app for trimming. This way, you can also get a good idea on the parts of the videos you’re cutting right from the Splitter itself.

 Now, when it comes to actual splitting, you can create as many clips as you like and then split them all in a single go. The app is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and you can download it from the official website with a single click.

1. Take full-resolution snapshots from videos in the JPEG/PNG format.
2. Change the rotation/orientation metadata in videos.
3. Extract audio tracks from your files losslessly.
4. Use a per-file time code offset from the preview.

 The app is available in both free and paid formats. To download the free version, you will have to grab the executable files which you will then have to execute for running the app. Alternatively, you can buy the app from Microsoft Store.

## Expert Tips: Making Windows Menus Less Obvious

 File Explorer has a Hidden items option you can select to reveal hidden files and folders. Those are mainly important system files and folders hidden for good reason. However, you can also select to hide user files as well.

 Explorerâ€™s **View** menu and tab (in Windows 10) include the **Hidden items** option. However, you can make that option a little more accessible by adding it to the context menu. Then you can toggle hidden files on/off from the right-click menu. This is how you can add a **Hidden items** option to the context menu in Windows 10 and 11\.

## How to Add a Hidden Items Option to the Context Menu With a Registry Script

 To add any new option to a Windows context menu, we must modify the registry. Adding a **Hidden items** option to the context menu involves a slightly more complicated registry tweak. So, itâ€™s best to add such an option to the right-click menu with a more automated registry script method like this:

1. Open this [Winaero download page](https://winaero.com/download-toggle-hidden-items-context-menu-in-windows-10-regsitry-tweak/) in web-browsing software.
2. Then select **Click here to download the file** option for the registry script archive.
3. Press both the **Windows** logo and **E** keyboard keys at the same time to [access File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
4. Navigate to whatever folder the **hidden\_files\_context\_menu** ZIP downloaded in.
5. Unzip (extract) the **hidden\_files\_context\_menu** ZIP file. We have a guide that includes instructions for [unzipping ZIP archives in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/).

5. Select **OK** on the second dialog box that appears.

 Now bring up the root C: directory in File Explorer to try out the new **Hidden items** context menu option. Right-click anywhere inside that folder to select **Show more options** on Windows 11â€™s context menu and **Hidden items**. Selecting that option will reveal a few hidden folders in the root directory if that setting isnâ€™t enabled already. Click the same option again to hide the folder and files again.

## Toggle Hidden Items On and Off From File Explorerâ€™s Context Menu

 So, now you can select to show or hide files and folders from your context menu. If you select to show hidden items, you can see and access more folders and files in Windows. A context menu option for enabling/disabling hidden items can be especially useful for users who select to hide things with the attribute settings for files and folders.

 Explorerâ€™s **View** menu and tab (in Windows 10) include the **Hidden items** option. However, you can make that option a little more accessible by adding it to the context menu. Then you can toggle hidden files on/off from the right-click menu. This is how you can add a **Hidden items** option to the context menu in Windows 10 and 11\.

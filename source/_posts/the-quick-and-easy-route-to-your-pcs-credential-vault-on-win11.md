## The Quick and Easy Route to Your PC's Credential Vault on Win11

 Credential Manager in Windows 11 stores all the username and password combinations that you use for websites you visit in Edge browsers, apps, or networks. Microsoft introduced Credential Manager with Windows 10 and since then it stores and manages all credentials in one place. You can even back up and remove credential entries that are obsolete.

 The most obvious method to access the Credential Manager is using the Control Panel. But do you know that there are other methods to access this password management too? We will list out all the possible ways to open it quickly. Let’s begin.

## 1\. Using Start Menu

 The Start menu is the most-visited section by Windows users. To access Credential Manager using the Start menu, repeat the following steps:

1. Press the**Win** key to open the Start menu.
2. Type**Credentials Manager** and click on the**Open** option.
3. The Credential Manager utility will launch on your system.

## 4\. Using the File Explorer

 Credential Manager’s DLL file is located inside the SysWoW64 folder. You can access it using File Explorer and then run it using Control Panel. Ensure that you have administrator privileges to access the SysWOW64 folder before trying this method. Here’s how:

1. Press**Win + E** to[launch the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) .
2. Go to the address bar, paste the following path, and press the**Enter** key:**C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64**

4. Select**Show more options** from the context menu and then click on the**Open with** option.
5. Scroll down and click on the**Choose an app on your PC** option.
6. Navigate to the C drive and click on the Windows folder. Then, open the SysWOW64 folder.
7. Find the**Control.exe** program and select it. Click on the**Open** button.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using the File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-the-file-explorer.jpg)
8. Window Control Panel will be added to the list of supported programs.**Double-click** on it to open keymgr.dll file in Control Panel.

## 6\. Using Control Panel

 Control Panel is the central hub for many system utilities and also contains Credential Manager. If you prefer the GUI method to open any Windows utility, you can use Control Panel. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press**Win + R** to launch the Run command box. Type**control** and press the**Enter** key.
2. In the Control Panel window, click on the**User Accounts** option.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-control-panel.jpg)
3. Lastly, click on the**Credential Manager** option to launch the tool.

## 7\. Using a Desktop Shortcut

 A desktop shortcut can save much time in Credential Manager on the system. Since it is not an executable program but a DLL file, merely making a desktop shortcut won’t work. Instead, we will create a shortcut of the Credential Manager DLL file and configure it to open with Control Panel.

 Repeat the following steps to create a shortcut for Credential Manager:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to Desktop.
2. Right-click on the Desktop and select the**New > Shortcut** option from the context menu.
3. In the Create Shortcut window, paste the following text in the Location box:**control.exe /name Microsoft.CredentialManager**

4. Credential Manager will open. Type the**exit** command in the PowerShell window and press the**Enter** key to close it.

## 10\. Using a Batch File

 A batch file is a more convenient method to open Credential Manager whenever you need it. You can place it on the desktop and run it with administrator privileges just like a shortcut. Repeat the following steps to create a batch file:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to the Desktop. Right-click on the desktop and select the**New > Text Document** option.
2. Open the empty text document and paste the following code snippet:  
`@echo off powershell.exe control.exe keymgr.dll`
3. Press**Ctrl + Shift + S** to open the**Save as** window. Name the file “**CredMgr.bat** ” and click on the**Save** button.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using a Batch File](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-batch-file.jpg)
4. Close the Notepad file. Navigate to the location where you saved the CredMgr.bat file.

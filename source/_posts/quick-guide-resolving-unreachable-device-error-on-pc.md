## Quick Guide: Resolving Unreachable Device Error on PC

 Error 0x80070141 arises for some users when they try to transfer image or video files from iPhones to Windows PCs via USB cables. The error 0x80070141 message says, “An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file… the device is unreachable.” Users can’t directly copy images or videos from their mobiles to Windows computers.

 When users can’t transfer files from mobiles to PCs, they can’t view and edit them on Windows PCs. Do you need to fix error 0x80070141 on your PC? If yes, this is how to resolve the 0x80070141 Windows 10 and 11 error.

## 1\. Utilize the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 The Hardware and Devices troubleshooter is a slightly hidden one in Windows you can activate with the Command Prompt. Some users have said utilizing that troubleshooter helped them to error fix 0x80070141\. You can access the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter like this:

1. Connect your iPhone to the PC before running the troubleshooter.
2. Click inside the Search box or press the magnifying glass button on your Windows taskbar.
3. Then input the **CMD** keyword to find the Windows Command Prompt app.
4. Click on **Command Prompt** within your search results to run that app.

7. Click **Apply** **this fix** for resolutions the troubleshooter offers.

## 2\. Connect Your Mobile to a Different USB Port

 There could be an issue with one of your PC’s USB ports. To check if that’s the case, try connecting your iPhone with a different USB slot on your PC. For example, plug your phone’s cable into a USB 2.0 slot instead of a USB 3.0 one.

## 3\. Try a Different USB Cable

 A few users who’ve fixed error 0x80070141 have said they needed to change USB cables for connecting their phones. So, closely inspect the condition of your USB cable. If you have an alternative USB cable, try connecting your Apple mobile to your PC with it.

## 4\. Select the Keep Originals Option on Your iPhone

 Selecting the **Download and Keep Originals** iPhone option is one of the most widely confirmed fixes for error 0x80070141\. That option will transfer image files in their original HEIC format when selected. You can select **Keep Originals** on your iPhone like this:

1. Turn on your iPhone and tap Settings.
2. Select **Photos** in Settings.
3. Then select the **Keep Originals** transfer setting.
4. Also, select the **Download and Keep Originals** option from there.

 If this potential solution works, your transferred images will be in the HEIC format, which is not widely supported by Windows software. You can convert your HEIC files to JPG format with this [FreeConvert web app](https://www.freeconvert.com/heic-to-jpg). Click on that app’s **Choose Files** option, select your images, and press the **Convert** button.

 Alternatively, you can enable HEIC support on Windows by installing HEIF Image Extensions. Open this [HEIF Image Extensions](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/heif-image-extensions/9PMMSR1CGPWG?hl=en-gb&gl=gb&rtc=1) page and click the **Get in Store** app and **Open Microsoft Store** options. Select **Get** within the HEIF Image Extensions MS Store window.

## 5\. Shorten Long File Titles

 Error 0x80070141 can also occur because of overly long file names that exceed length restrictions in Windows. So, try shortening some images or videos with very long file names before attempting to transfer them onto Windows. This is how you can rename the files:

1. First, connect your Apple mobile device to the PC you need to transfer files to.
2. Then [open the Explorer file manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and select your connected iPhone.
3. Right-click a file with a long name stored on your iPhone and select **Rename**.  
![The Rename option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rename-option3.jpg)
4. Enter a file title that’s a lot shorter than 256 characters.
5. Then right-click the shortened file to select **Copy**.
6. Press **Ctrl** \+ **V** within a folder on your Windows PC to transfer it.

## 6\. Update the iTunes Software

 If error 0x80070141 occurs when trying to transfer files with iTunes, make sure you’re utilizing the latest version of that software. You could completely reinstall iTunes to do that, but it’s not necessary to do so. This is how you can check for iTunes updates:

2. Click the **Help** menu.
3. Select **Check for updates** on the menu.

4. Press the **Download iTunes** button if there’s an available update.

## 7\. Reinstall the Connected Device

 A mobile device reinstallation could also feasibly fix error 0x80070141 for some users. You can do that by selecting to uninstall a connected iPhone as follows:

1. Plug your iPhone into a PC with its USB cable.
2. Press both the **Windows** logo + **X** keyboard keys to view the shortcuts on the Power User menu.
3. Click on that menu’s **Device Manager** shortcut.

7. Then unplug your mobile device and select to restart Windows.
8. Reconnect your iPhone and reopen Device Manager.
9. Click the **Action** menu to select **Scan for hardware changes**.

## 8\. Select the Media Device (MTP) Option

 Error 0x80070141 can also occur when trying to move or copy files from Android phones to Windows PCs. If you’re an Android mobile phone user, selecting the **Media device (MTP)** protocol option could resolve that issue. This is how you can select the **MTP** option on an Android phone like this:

1. Turn on your Android mobile.
2. Plug your Android phone into a USB slot on your PC.
3. Swipe down from the top of the Android mobile.
4. Then tap on **Connected as**.
5. Select the **Media device (MTP)** option.

## 9\. Utilize Cloud Storage Instead

 You don’t have to transfer images and videos from your iPhone to your PC with a USB cable. Instead, try uploading and downloading files from your iPhone to your PC by utilizing cloud storage services such as iCloud. Check out our guide to [utilizing iCloud in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/icloud-windows-pc-use/) for further details about how you can move files between devices with that cloud storage service.

You can sync files between your PC and mobile with the Google Drive desktop software. Our [Google Drive for desktop guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-drive-for-desktop/) includes full instructions about how to sync files with that software.

## 9 Ways to Fix the No Servers Found Error in Apex Legends for Windows

 Apex Legends is one of Windows's most popular Battle Royale Hero shooter games. But like any other online game, it can run into issues from time to time. One of the popular Apex Legends problems is the "no server found" error code.

 The error indicates that there's an issue in connecting with the game servers. So, if you also encounter the same problem, consider trying the below solutions.

## What Triggers the "No Server Found" Error in Apex Legends?

 One of the instances in which the error code can appear is when the game servers are currently facing downtime. But there are many more reasons that can be responsible for the issue. Let's check them out first before driving into the solutions.

1. Running the game without administrative rights is one of the most prominant reasons why Apex Legends can't find any servers.
2. Some outdated or corrupt network adapters can affect your connectivity and cause the problem at hand.
3. A corrupt DNS cache data is another reason Apex Legends cannot connect with the servers.

Now let's check out all the solutions in detail.

## 1\. Check the Apex Legends Server Status

 Like any other online multiplayer game, Apex Legends servers can face downtime. If the game is experiencing an outage or maintenance, you'll be unable to connect to them.

 So, whenever you face the problem at hand, first check the server status of the game. You can do this by visiting the [Apex Legends server-status checking webpage](https://apexlegendsstatus.com/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Most of server connection-related issues in online multiplayer games often result from a weak internet connection. So, check the internet connection whenever you face the problem at hand. You can do it by visiting one of the [internet-speed checking websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) .

 If you are getting a comparatively lower speed, consider power cycling the router. If that doesn't help, contact your ISP.

## 3\. Run Apex Legends With Administrative Rights

 Running apps without administrative rights can cause issues, especially if the app requires an internet connection. So, ensure you are running Apex Legends as an administrator. Here's how.

1. Right-click on Apex Legends and choose**Properties.**
2. Switch to the**Compatibility** tab.
3. Checkmark**Run this program as an administrator** option.
4. Click on**Apply** \>**OK** .

Relaunch the game and check if you still face the problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Switch to a Different Server

![Different servers of Apex Legends](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/different-servers.jpg)

 Another quick way to resolve the issue is to switch to a different server within your region. However, this fix will only be helpful if there's a regional server outage. If all the servers are down, then try the next solution.

 Also, be prepared to experience comparatively higher ping on the new server, but it's still better than waiting for the servers to become operational again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Verify Games Files

![Repair option in EA app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/repair.jpg)

 Games may start misbehaving and throw different errors if there's corruption in their files. Fortunately, you can quickly eliminate this issue by verifying the game files.

 When you verify game files, launchers will compare the game files on your computer with those on its servers. If it finds corruption in any file, it'll automatically replace it with its counterpart. Here's how to verify Apex Legends files in the EA app:

1. Launch the EA app on your computer.
2. Choose**Library** from the left sidebar.
3. Click the**three dots** on the Apex Legends icon and choose**Repair** from the menu that crops up.

 After completing the verification process, restart the EA app and check for the issue. If you're using any other launcher, check our guide on [verifying game files on different launchers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-verify-game-file-integrity-different-launchers/) .

## 6\. Turn Off Any Proxy Server Connections

 A proxy server is useful for keeping yourself safe online. On the other hand, it can make some connections unstable and cause different issues, including Apex Legends' "no servers found" problem.

 Try turning off any active proxy server connections and check if it fixes the issue. Here's how to do it.

1. Open the**Start Menu** , type**Internet Options** , and press Enter.
2. Click on the**Connections** tab.
3. Choose**LAN settings** .
4. Uncheck**Use a proxy server for your LAN box** .  
![Turn off proxy on Internet Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Turn-off-proxy.jpg)
5. Click on**OK.**

 Try to connect with the game servers again and check if the problem is fixed.

## 7\. Update Your Network Adapter Drivers

 As aforementioned, corrupt or outdated network adapters can adversely affect the connectivity. So, to keep the system free from connection issues, download the latest network driver update. Here's how.

1. Press Win + X and choose Device Manager from the context menu.
2. Right-click on the installed**Network adapters** and choose**Update driver** .  
![The network adapters section in Windows Device Manager.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/update-network-drivers-win-11.jpg)
3. Click on**Search automatically for drivers** .
4. Windows will now look for and download the best available driver update.

 Check if the issue is fixed or not. If Windows can't find any drivers, look online for your adapter's manufacturer and see if they have newer drivers on its support page.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. Close Any Bandwidth Consuming Applications

 Different background running applications will constantly keep consuming bandwidth and can cause the problem at hand. As a solution, close all such applications. Here's how.

1. Open the**Task Manager** using**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** hotkeys.
2. In the**Processes** tab, right-click on all the bandwidth-consuming applications like Google Chrome and choose**End task** .  
![Task Manager End task option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Task-Manager.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Launch the game and check for the problem.

## 9\. Switch to Google's DNS Server

 The next solution on the list is to switch to the Google DNS server. As it turns out, if your current [DNS server](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-dns-server/) is unstable, you will most likely face the issue.

 While there are a lot of public DNS servers you can use, Google's servers are easy to remember and have good performance. So, here's how to connect to the Google DNS server.

1. Open**Settings** using**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Choose**Network & Internet** from the left pane.
3. Head towards**Wi-Fi > Hardware Properties** .
4. Click on**Edit** next to the**DNS server assignment** .

5. Click on the drop-down icon under**Edit DNS settings** , and choose**Manual** from the context menu.
6. As per your DNS provider, choose**IPv4** or**IPv6.**
7. If you choose**IPv4,** enter**8.8.8.8** and**8.8.4.4** in**Preferred** and**Alternate DNS servers,** respectively.
8. If you choose**IPv6,** enter**2001:4860:4860::8888** and**2001:4860:4860::8844** in**Preferred** and**Alternate DNS servers,** respectively.  
![Edit DNS settings screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IPv6-settings.jpg)
9. Click on**Save.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 10\. Clear the DNS Cache

 The DNS cache data contains information related to computer DNS queries. But if the DNS cache data gets corrupted for some reason, it'll result in different issues, including one in the question.

 As a solution, consider clearing the DNS cache data. You can do it by following the below steps.

1. Open**Command Prompt** using one of the [many ways to open the command prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) .
2. Type**ipconfig /flushdns** and press Enter.  
![running flushdns command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/flushdns-terminal.png)

 Wait until the process is complete. Once done, reboot the system and check for the issue.

## 11\. Reset Your Network

 If none of the steps was helpful, consider resetting the network settings. Resetting the network settings will remove and reinstall the network adapters and set the network components to their default values.

 You can [reset the network settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) by following the below steps.

1. Open**Settings** .
2. Choose**Network & internet** \>**Advanced network settings** \>**Network reset** .
3. Click on**Reset now** next to**Network reset** .
4. Click**Yes** to confirm your selection.

 After the reset process is complete, you'll notice you are no longer facing the problem.

## 12\. Try Different Launcher

 Are you still experiencing server issues in Apex Legends? If so, the problem may be with your launcher rather than your system.

 The only solution here is to switch to a different game launcher. If you're using Origin, try switching to Steam or vice versa.

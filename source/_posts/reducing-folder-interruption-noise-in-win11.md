## Reducing Folder Interruption Noise in Win11

 Microsoft was hoping to launch the tabs feature in the File Explorer app for Windows 10\. But it scrapped the idea later on. However, with the Windows 11 22H2 update, users can now try out the tabs feature in File Explorer. The participants of the Windows Insider Program got early access to the feature and Microsoft could soon apply the tabs idea to Windows Notepad as well.

 But what if you want to turn the File Explorer Tabs feature off? An immediate idea would be to uninstall the update, but that is a temporary workaround. You can use ViVeTool to enable or disable the tabs feature or any other new feature of Windows 11.

## What Is ViVeTool?

 ViVeTool is an open-source command line tool that can enable or disable Windows operating system features. Microsoft continuously works on many experimental features and does a lot of testing before rolling out a stable version of a feature. But if you are impatient, you can use ViVeTool to enable an otherwise hidden feature. It is free and the developers recently launched a GUI version of the tool as well.

## How to Disable File Explorer Tabs In Windows 11

 You can disable the File Explorer Tabs by either using the ViVeTool or the ViVeTool GUI version. The latter is much simpler to use because you can search for a feature and activate or deactivate it in one click. But before doing that, download and install both of these tools on your system. Also,[create a system restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) for added precaution, in case the tool wrecks something on your Windows 11 computer.

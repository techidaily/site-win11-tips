 Although the Windows computer comes preset with a default mouse cursor, not everyone is a fan. Thankfully, Microsoft comes with a feature on Windows that lets you set a new cursor or modify your existing cursor for a newer, refined one.

 Today, we'll tackle exactly that. We'll dive into the different ways to tweak the mouse cursor on your Windows computer and then lay out how you can do it, too.

 There's a lot you can do to change your cursor. For example, you can entirely change the cursor type, tweak the cursor scheme, or even modify the cursor color or speed. So, with a few tweaks here and there, you can change almost everything about your mouse cursor.

 The**Control Panel** is one of the oldest apps in the Windows operating system, first released way back in 1985\. It is majorly used for managing your computer hardware and software.

![make the mouse easier to use](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/make-the-mouse-easier-to-use.jpg)

 On the next page, you'll get three different sections from where you can tweak your mouse settings:

1. Mouse pointers
2. Control the mouse with the keyboard
3. Make it easier to manage Windows

 From the**Mouse pointers** section, you can change the color and size of mouse pointers that will be more suitable for your personalized settings; Regular White, Large Black, Extra Large Inverting, etc., are just some of the designs to pick from.

 Next, the**Control the mouse with the keyboard** section lets you turn on your mouse keys, which basically means you can move your mouse around with the numeric keypad itself.

 Similarly, when you check the radio box for**Turn on Mouse Keys** , you'll be able to use a numeric keypad to move the mouse around the screen.

## Customize Your Windows Cursor to Your Taste

### Fix 1: Check your computer specs

 The minimum system requirements need to be met to run _Borderlands 3_ smoothly; otherwise, you’re likely to encounter game issues like freezing, lagging and crashing.

 Here are _**Borderlands 3**_ **‘s minimum system requirements** :

| **OS:**            | Windows 7/10 (latest service pack)               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor:**     | AMD FX-8350 (Intel i5-3570)                      |
| **Graphics Card:** | AMD Radeon™ HD 7970 (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 2GB) |
| **RAM** :          | 6 GB                                             |

Follow the instructions below to view your computer hardware information:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog.

 Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements to run the game, then move on to the fix below.

### Fix 2: Rule out driver issues

 An incompatible graphics driver is one of the most common causes of game issues, such as the game freezing, lagging, and crashing.

 If_Borderlands 3_ freezing issue occurs after updating your graphics driver, it is either because the latest version of the driver is not compatible with your game or because the driver is not properly installed on your PC. If it’s the first case, **[rolling back your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to the previous version should fix your problem.

 If rolling back your graphics driver didn’t help, or you haven’t updated your graphics drivers for a long time, you should **[update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to the latest version.

#### Roll back your graphics driver

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**device manager** . Then, click**Device Manager** .

#### Update your graphics drivers

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-07-25.jpg)

 Try launching _Borderlands 3_ to see if it works properly now. If not, check the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Check for Windows updates

 Regularly updating your operating system is crucial for resolving compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities that may cause game issues. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-13-29.jpg)

**2)**  Click **Check for updates,**  and then wait for Windows to download and install the updates automatically.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-13-35.jpg)

 Restart your computer and your game after the update is complete. If the freezing issue happens again, try the fix, below.

### Fix 7: Adjust your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive.

 If your computer runs out of RAM when running_Borderland 3_ , Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, the game could easily freeze or crash.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings** . Then, click **View advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-13-29-1.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_14-04-17.jpg)

**3)**  Click**Advanced** \>**Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-19-52.jpg)

**4)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-21-05.jpg)

**6)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-21-39.jpg)

**7)** Click the button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-21-43.jpg)

**8)** Click **Set** \>**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-28_12-21-48.jpg)

**9)** Restart your computer and your game.

 You should be able to run the game without freezing now. If the issue continues to occur, don’t fret. There is still 1 more fix to try.

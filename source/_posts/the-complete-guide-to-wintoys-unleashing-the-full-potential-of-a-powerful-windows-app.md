 Look at Wintoys like your Windows control panel with all the information you need available a click or two away. With the Home Page giving you system specs, you have pages for Apps, Services, Boost, Health, and Tweaks.

 You'll find all the apps on the Apps page, which even lets you uninstall some apps that don't allow uninstallation by default. You can view all services on the Services page, even those that are unnecessary and can be uninstalled.

 The Boost screen has features and settings that you can use to enhance the performance of your PC like the Ultimate Performance Power Plan. With the Health page, you can keep Windows in its optimal condition and even perform scans like SFC and DISM without Command Prompt to check and repair your PC.

 You can even personalize your desktop, start menu, and file explorer via the Tweaks page and take control over your ads and privacy settings to cut out disturbances and use Windows privately.

 Plus, everything is designed to be snappy and easy, like quick tips to get you started, simple toggles to turn settings on and off, shortcuts to key features, and simple features and settings descriptions that make using Wintoys a breeze.

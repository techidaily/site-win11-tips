## How to Enable RGB Lighting Controls in Windows 11

 RGB-laden computer peripherals are an established medium to spruce up the design of computers. In the last five years, we have seen almost every computer accessory pack RGB lighting effects of some sort or the other. Even laptops are extensions of the RGB theme beyond the backlit keyboard and adding lighting to the chassis.

 But as far as color tweaking goes, Windows users have to use custom or third-party software for their computer accessories (if the device supports it). However, Microsoft is testing an RGB Lighting control feature that could potentially eliminate the need for such software. Want to try it out? Letâ€™s begin.

## Do You Really Need RGB Lighting Controls on Windows?

 If you use any external peripherals (especially gaming-related), RGB lighting has a great visual appeal. Even[the best gaming accessories](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-laptop-gaming-accessories/) (mouse, keyboard, and controllers) now have some form of RGB lighting embedded in them. Expensive products offer slightly better customizations compared to moderately priced ones.

 If you want to customize the RGB lighting effects, you need a compatible software counterpart. Renowned gaming accessories brands offer custom software which allows you to adjust lighting effects, modes, and even brightness.

 If you like to shop between brands, it gets tedious to install a dedicated program for every RGB accessory you have. Not everyone uses all peripherals from a single brand which means you need to install multiple software for customizing RGB effects.

 Microsoft noticed this problem and put forward a plan to unite all RBG accessories on Windows 11\. The Windows Insider build 25295 has a hidden experimental feature that adds a Lighting option in the Personalization section of the Settings app.

 This setting will act as a central hub to manage and tweak all the connected devices with RGB lighting. So, you will need fewer or no third-party apps for adjusting RGB effects on any connected device in Windows 11.

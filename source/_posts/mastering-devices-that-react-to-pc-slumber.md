 Windows gives you complete control over devices that can wake your computer from a sleep state. In this guide, we will discuss how you can manage those devices.

3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.

## How to Find Out What Woke Your Windows PC From Sleep Mode

 Many times, you may find that your Windows computer wakes from sleep mode on its own. Often, it's one of the connected devices or processes that causes your computer to wake up. Windows can tell you exactly what woke your computer from sleep mode.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**cmd** in the box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to[launch Command Prompt with admin rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .

`powercfg -lastwake`

 Once you run the above command, Windows will tell you which device or process woke your computer from sleep mode.

 If you see something like**Wake History Count - 0** , it means that Windows doesn't have a record of wake history. This can happen if you've recently rebooted your computer.

## How to Allow or Deny a Device Permission to Wake Your Windows PC From Sleep Mode

 Once you know which devices are waking up your computer without your consent, you can take the necessary steps to prevent them from doing so.

To allow or deny a device permission to wake your computer:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Device Manager** from the list.
3. Locate the device you want to configure. Right-click on it and select**Properties** .
4. In the Properties window, switch to the**Power Management** tab.
5. Check or uncheck the**Allow this device to wake the computer** checkbox to allow or disallow the permission.
6. Click**OK** to save the changes.

## Resolving ONEDRIVE Login Failure: X.8004DEC5 Windows Issue

 Microsoft's cloud storage service OneDrive simplifies file management on Windows. However, you might experience issues when signing in to OneDrive, like the 0x8004dec5 error. This article will guide you on how to resolve OneDrive sign-in error 0x8004dec5 specifically on Windows 11\.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 If you’re having trouble signing in to OneDrive, first [check your internet connection](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-check-wifi-network-strength/). Slow or spotty internet causes sign-in problems. So, check your connection speed and make sure it’s strong enough for OneDrive. If necessary, reset your router or modem to restore the connection.

 If your internet connection is working, restart your computer and sign in to OneDrive again. This simple step fixes minor errors in the operating system that may cause the sign-in issue.

## 2\. Run the Network Troubleshooter

 If your internet connection is stable, but you’re still having OneDrive sign-in problems, you can run the Internet Connections Troubleshooter. This diagnosis tool scans for network problems and repairs any issues it finds.

 To run the Internet Connection Troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select **Run** from the menu list.  
![Open Internet Connections](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/open-internet-connections.jpg)
2. In the dialog box, type the following command and click **OK**.  
`msdt.exe -id NetworkDiagnosticsWeb`
3. Click **Advanced** and check **Apply repairs automatically**.  
![Run the Internet Connections troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-the-internet-connections-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. Now click **Next** and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the troubleshooting process.

 Once it’s done, sign into OneDrive and see if the error is fixed. If not, try the next solution.

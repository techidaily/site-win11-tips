## Enlightenment Guide: Activating Higher Power on Windows 11

 Since Windows 8 over a decade ago, Microsoft has pushed for the Settings app to replace the ever-reliable Control Panel. Windows 11, in addition to its sleek UI upgrade, also brought us the best version of the Settings app in terms of usability and function.

If you’re tired of looking for needles in the haystack that is the Settings app, you need to learn all about God Mode on Windows 11.

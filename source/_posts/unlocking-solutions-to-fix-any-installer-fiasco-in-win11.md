## 8\. Re-Register the Windows Installer Service

 If restarting the Windows Installer service has had no effect, try re-registering the service. Re-registering a service is somewhat similar to reinstalling it, as you can't uninstall services through regular means.

 This is how you can re-register Windows Installer with a couple of commands:

1. To search for Command Prompt, press **Win + S** and type in "CMD".
2. When the Command Prompt appears in the search, click **Run as administrator** on the right side of the search tool.
3. Type in (or copy and paste) this command and hit **Enter**:  
`msiexec.exe /unregister`  
![The unregister service command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-unregister-command.jpg)
4. Execute this command for re-registering Windows Installer:

## 9\. Perform a Windows Clean Boot

 Disabling all third-party software and services that start with Windows is called "clean booting". Clean booting might disable some startup items that were conflicting with the installation process. Security programs are the most likely software packages to cause installation issues.

 You can disable startup services and apps via MSConfig and Task Manager, as instructed in our article about [how to clean boot Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). Restart your PC after setting up the clean boot. Then have another go at installing the affected software packages.

![The Services tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-services-tab2.jpg)

 If this resolution solves the issue, you can install the software you currently need and restore the standard boot configuration afterward. However, the error might reoccur in the future when you try to install more software. So, it’s better to try and identify what app or service was causing the issue and keep it disabled.

## Install All the Windows Software Packages You Need Again

 The potential resolutions covered in this guide will likely be enough to remedy the “problem with this Windows Installer” error on most PCs. It is a commonly reported Windows error many users have fixed by applying those potential solutions. Beyond those possible fixes, more drastic measures like resetting or reinstalling Windows might be required.

 Lots of users have reported the “problem with this Windows installer package” error occurs when trying to install iTunes. However, this issue can affect the installation of many other Windows programs. This is how you can fix the “problem with his Windows installer package” error.

## 2\. Free Up Hard Drive Space

 Error 0x80070185 can arise when there’s very little free space available on the local drive. As such, your PC’s hard drive may have insufficient space for the larger files in your OneDrive cloud storage.

 First, check your PC’s drive storage space by launching File Explorer and clicking**This PC** . The C: drive icon there shows you how much free storage is available.

![The Local Disk storage icon](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/local-disk-storage-icon.jpg)

 If your PC’s hard drive is full, or close to it, free up some storage space. You can make more space on your hard drive by uninstalling software, deleting unneeded user files, and erasing junk data. Our guide about[how to free up storage space in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-free-up-storage-space/) includes numerous methods for making space on a drive.

## 3\. Reset the OneDrive App

 Corrupted OneDrive cache data is a potential cause for error 0x80070185 that you can address by resetting the app. Reset OneDrive with Run as follows:

1. Bring up the Power User shortcuts menu by pressing the**Win + X** keys.
2. Select**Run** to view that command dialog.
3. Type or paste the following command for resetting OneDrive into Run:  
`%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe /reset`

4. Click**OK** to execute the reset command for OneDrive.

5. If the OneDrive icon doesn’t reappear after the reset, input this command into Run and click**OK** :  
`%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe`

## 4\. Sync OneDrive to Another Drive Location

## 5\. Enable the "Always Keep on Device" and "Free Up Space" Options

 Some OneDrive users have confirmed selecting to always keep affected files on the device, along with a "free up space" option, can fix error 0x80070185\. Selecting the "always keep on this device" option makes a OneDrive file available offline.

 This is how you can select those options for an affected OneDrive file:

1. Press**Win + E** to open File Explorer.
2. Click the arrow for your OneDrive storage on the left of Explorer.
3. Right-click the file affected by error 0x80070185 and select**Always keep on this** **device** .  
![The Always keep on this device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/always-keep-on-this-device-option.jpg)
4. Then right-click the same file again to select**Free up** **space** .

## 6\. Turn Off Any Active Firewalls

 Firewall blocks applied to OneDrive can sometimes cause the error 0x80070185 to occur. We recommend users temporarily turn off firewalls to see if they’re causing this issue. You can turn off the Windows Defender Firewall with the following steps:

1. Click the**Search** box or a magnifying glass icon on your Windows taskbar.
2. Input**Windows Defender Firewall** to find the applet.
3. Select the**Windows Defender Firewall** search result to view the applet in the Control Panel.
4. Click**Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** to access the settings.  
![The Windows Defender Firewall applet](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-defender-firewall-applet.jpg)
5. Select the two**Turn off Windows Defender Firewall** network settings, and click**OK** to apply.  
![The Turn off Windows Defender Firewall option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/turn-off-windows-defender-firewall-option.jpg)
6. Return to OneDrive to see if the 0x80070185 error persists with the firewall off.

 It’s also recommended to turn off any third-party firewalls installed. Some antivirus utilities also have firewalls. If you’ve installed any additional security software, select the option to disable its firewall if it has one.

 Should this potential solution resolve error 0x80070185, set up a firewall exception for OneDrive. You can do that for the Windows firewall as instructed in our[how to allow apps through Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) piece. Users with third-party firewalls can allow OneDrive through them with the exclusion settings in their security apps.

## 7\. Reinstall OneDrive

 Reinstalling OneDrive is a solution that’s worked for some users. This will give you a completely fresh and up-to-date OneDrive app. These are the steps for uninstalling and reinstalling OneDrive:

1. Launch Run (see[how to open Run](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) for instructions) and input**ms-settings:appsfeatures** inside its**Open** box.
2. Select**OK** to view Apps & features in Settings.
3. If you’re using Windows 11’s Settings app, click OneDrive’s three-menu button and click**Uninstall** . You can select OneDrive and press**Uninstall** in Windows 10.

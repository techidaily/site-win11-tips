## 5\. Turn Off Any Active Antivirus Apps

The usual way to do that is to right-click an antivirus system tray icon and select a context menu setting for temporarily disabling its shied for a few hours. Then select to download/install the Microsoft Store apps for which error 0x80073CF3 occurs with the antivirus software deactivated.

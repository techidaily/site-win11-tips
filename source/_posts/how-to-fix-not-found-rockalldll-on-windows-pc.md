 This article will review the different methods at your disposal to help you eliminate the Rockalldll.dll error on Windows.

## How to Fix the Rockalldll.dll Not Found or Missing Error on Windows PC

 Before we jump into the fixes, it's worth learning about what the Rockalldll.dll file is and what it does. DLL files are a collection of reusable code in the form of various classes, functions, and other variables.

 The Rockalldll.dll file is a specific type of DLL file that usually comes with games or other similar programs. It's also important to note that if you got the file through torrent or somewhere similar, your chances of facing this error increase a lot. Here’s how the Rockalldll.dll error usually pops up on Windows:

* The program can't start because rockalldll.dll is missing from your computer.
* Rockalldll.dll Not Found.
* The file rockalldll.dll is missing.

 From here, there’s a host of routes at your disposal to fix your Rockalldll.dll error, and we’ve covered them all below. Before you do that, however, make sure you give your PC a quick restart; a simple reboot tends to resolve many problems, and it might just fix the rockalldll.dll error for you as well.

## 1\. Reinstall DirectX

 DirectX is a collection of APIs that allow your PC to render graphics from games and similar programs. It contains the Rockalldll.dll file, so reinstalling it might help you out. T

 To do this, look through the affected game's folders for a file called**DXSETUP** , usually within a DirectX folder. Double-click it and let it reinstall Rockalldll.dll.

## 2\. Update Your Windows

 Are you keeping up with all your Windows updates? If you haven’t been updating Windows regularly, it’s not uncommon to encounter all kinds of DLL errors. As such, updating Windows can fix the “rockalldll.dll not found” error. Here's how:

1. Head to the Settings menu.
2. Select**Windows Update** .
3. Click on**Check for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 That's it. Windows Update will run and download any recent updates. Depending on when you last ran Windows Update, it will take anywhere from a minute to half an hour.

## 3\. Check Your PC for Malware

 Are abrupt errors a regular occurrence on your PC, or is the rockalldll.dll error the first time you’ve encountered something like this? If you believe errors like this are a recurrence, then it's possible that your PC might be infected by [malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-malware-and-how-does-it-work/) . So giving your PC a quick malware scan will help ensure everything is ship-shape.

Here’s how you can get started:

1. Press**Win + I** to open your Windows settings. Alternatively, head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in ‘settings,’ and select the**Best Match** .
2. Head to**Privacy & security > Windows Security** .
3. Click on**Open Windows Security** .
4. Now, select**Virus & threat protection** and click on**Quick scan** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Windows Security will begin scanning your PC for malware. Since this is a quick scan, you won’t have to wait too long. If it finds any viruses, it will remove them instantly and fix the rockalldll.dll error most probably as well.

 Before we jump to the next method below, though, we’d also encourage you to run a deep scan from time to time. While it's true that it will take more time than a regular, quick scan, the positives easily trump the seemingly high costs, i.e., a thorough clean-up of your PC for malicious threats.

 The option to do this is on the**Virus & threat protection** page. Click on**Scan options** and select either the**Full Scan** or**Microsoft Defender Scan** option. If you’re still on the fence about the complete scan, go through our [Windows Security guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-quick-security-guide/) to get a complete picture.

## 4\. Reinstall the Troublesome Program

 Reinstalling the program also tends to help sometimes. Whether it's a game or something else, if none of the above methods have worked so far, then removing the program and installing it again is worth a shot.

## 5\. Run an SFC or CHDSK Scan

 The System File Checker (SFC) tool is a free utility designed to look for and fix corrupted Windows files, including important DLL files. While it doesn't guarantee a fix, a quick SFC scan may be all

 you need to get rid of the “rockalldll.dll not found” error.

 To perform a scan, check out our guide on [how to run the System File Checker tool on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) . The SFC tool will start scanning your system for all errors it can find. If it finds any errors, it’ll usually try to fix them right then and there.

 If that doesn't find anything, CHDSK is also an excellent tool to get your PC fixed when it's plagued with random errors. It works by scanning your entire drive to find and fix any errors in files and the file system itself. To run CHDSK, we’ll make use of the Command Prompt in elevated mode. Here’s how:

1. Head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in ‘cmd,’ right-click on the top result. Select**Run as administrator** .
2. In the cmd, type in the following command and hit**Enter** :  
`chkdsk c:`
3. ![chkdsk cmd](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chkdsk-cmd.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 In the above command, we’re scanning the**C** drive. If you want to check another drive, change "C" with the desired drive's letter.

 The scan will be completed in a few seconds, and hopefully, along with it, the "Rockalldll.dll missing error" will be gone as well.

## 1\. Use the USB 2.0 Port

 There’s no secret that USB 3.0 give you plenty of advantages over USB 2.0\. However, USB 3.0 uses more endpoints, which might be enough to get Windows to show the “Not enough USB controller resources” error.

 In this case, connecting your devices through the USB 2.0 port might be enough to fix the problem, especially if you’re using a USB mouse or keyboard. Connecting them through the 2.0 port will have no negative impact on their functionality.

## 3\. Reinstall USB Drivers

 If running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter didn’t work, you should try reinstalling the USB drivers. Right-click the**Start** button and select**Device Manager** . Then, extend the**USB controllers** list and search for the drivers that include**Host Controller** in their name.

 Right-click one of them, select**Uninstall device** and confirm the action in the pop-up window. Restart your computer, so Windows will automatically reinstall the USB drivers. Alternatively, you could[use a free driver updater](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/) if an outdated or corrupt driver is causing the error.

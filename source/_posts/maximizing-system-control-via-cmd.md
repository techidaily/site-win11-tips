## Maximizing System Control via CMD

 The Command Prompt is a text-based interface on Windows that allows you to issue commands to perform various tasks. People usually refer to it as a command line, shell, or even by its filename. And although the Command Prompt might not be as user-friendly as Windows' graphical user interface, it offers you more control over your system.

 Some commands, however, require administrator-level privileges to run properly. As such, here are some quick and easy ways to open Command Prompt as an administrator in Windows.

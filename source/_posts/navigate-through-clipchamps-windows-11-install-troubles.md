## Navigate Through ClipChamp's Windows 11 Install Troubles

 Microsoft realized that Windows lacked an official solution to create videos. So, it acquired Clipchamp, a freemium online video editing tool, and began offering it in Microsoft Store. The tool is based on the concept of web-based tools like Canva that offer an app but use an internet connection to deliver a smooth editing experience.

 But many users face an issue while installing the Clipchamp video editing tool via Microsoft Store. If you are facing the same issue and want to install and try out the free video editing tool, don't fret! We will list all the possible solutions to fix the app installation issue on your system.

## What Is Clipchamp?

 Clipchamp is an online video editing tool with a few more features and enhancements. It's easy to use because it simplifies the process of video editing via the magnificent user interface.

 The app offers multiple editable templates (free and paid) using which you can [easily create cool videos on Windows with Clipchamp](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-clipchamp-create-cool-videos/) . Unlike Adobe or other video software, it doesn't stress your system resources and even offers the option to download your videos and share them with others.

## How to Fix Clipchamp Not Installing on Windows 11

 If you are unable to install this free video editing tool on your system, try out the following fixes to successfully install and run it on your computer.

### 1\. Completely Close and Relaunch the Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store app can become unresponsive and fail to install the app on your system. So, you must terminate the app and restart it. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app. Navigate to the left-hand side menu and click on the**Apps** option.
2. Click on the**Installed Apps** option. Then click on the**Search for app** option and type Microsoft Store.
3. Click on the three horizontal dots and select the**Advanced options** from the context menu.  
![Completely Close and Relaunch Microsoft Store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/completely-close-and-relaunch-microsoft-store.jpg)
4. Scroll down and click on the**Terminate** button. It will end the Microsoft process and close the app.

### 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If terminating the app doesn't do anything, do a system restart. It will clear all the apps from the memory, close all the background apps and services, and restart them. Do not use shutdown because Microsoft enables Fast start-up by default and that doesn't close system and kernel-level processes from the memory.

 After your computer restarts, launch Microsoft Store and try to install the Clipchamp app on your system.

### 3\. Set the Correct Time, Date, and Region

 Incorrect date and time and region settings can cause the Microsoft Store app to not load content or install apps properly. Here's how to update the date, time, and region on your system:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. Click on the**Time & language** option from the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on the**Date & time** option and then click on the**Sync now** button.  
![Set the Correct Time Date and Region 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/set-the-correct-time-date-and-region-1.jpg)
4. Scroll down and click on the**Language & region** option present under the Related links section.
5. Under the Region section, click on the**Country or region** option and select the appropriate country from the list.  
![Set the Correct Time Date and Region 2](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/set-the-correct-time-date-and-region-2.jpg)
6. Close the settings app and try to launch Clipchamp again. Check if the error still persists.

### 4\. Clear Microsoft Store Cache

 A corrupt or outdated Microsoft Store Cache can result in app launch and installation issues. So you must [clear the Microsoft Store app cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-reset-microsoft-store/) using the command prompt or the inbuilt reset option.

![Use Winget to Install Clipchamp](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/use-winget-to-install-clipchamp.jpg)
6. Read the EULA, type**Y** in the Terminal window and press enter.
7. Wait for the Winget utility to download and install Clipchamp on your system.
8. Close the Terminal window after installation completes.

### 7\. Run an SFC and DISM Scan

 If you repeatedly encounter installation errors in Microsoft Store,[running an SFC scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) can help you find and replace corrupt system files. After that, you can [run a DISM scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) to check Windows image health and repair the component store of the Windows image. It will take a while to run these scans and repair your system.

### 8\. Try the Web Version of Clipchamp

If you are new to Clipchamp just sign up for the service and log in with your account. Then you can edit videos online without requiring any app install on your system.

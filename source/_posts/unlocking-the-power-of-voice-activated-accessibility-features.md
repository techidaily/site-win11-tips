## Unlocking the Power of Voice-Activated Accessibility Features

 Narrator is a screen reader from Microsoft that assists with navigation and access to information. It reads text, provides voice assistance, and navigates screen content. Visually impaired or low-vision individuals can better comprehend what's on their computer screens with its help.

 In this article, we've put together a complete list of legacy keyboard shortcuts that you can use to make your Narrator experience more seamless.

## How Do I Switch Between Legacy and Standard Keyboard Layouts?

 There are two popular keyboard layouts for Narrator: Legacy and Standard. The Legacy keyboard layout was traditionally used on computers before the widespread adoption of the Standard layout. It's still in use today and offers advantages at certain times.

 If you are using one of these layouts and wish to switch to the other, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + Ctrl + N** on your keyboard.
2. Scroll down to the**Mouse and keyboard** section.
3. Select**Keyboard layout** from the drop-down menu.

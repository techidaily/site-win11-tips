## Unlocking the Power of Voice-Activated Accessibility Features

 Narrator is a screen reader from Microsoft that assists with navigation and access to information. It reads text, provides voice assistance, and navigates screen content. Visually impaired or low-vision individuals can better comprehend what's on their computer screens with its help.

 In this article, we've put together a complete list of legacy keyboard shortcuts that you can use to make your Narrator experience more seamless.

## How Do I Switch Between Legacy and Standard Keyboard Layouts?

1. Press**Win + Ctrl + N** on your keyboard.
2. Scroll down to the**Mouse and keyboard** section.

## Addressing Failure of Intel's Wi-Fi 6D Driver in OS

 You want to surf the net on your Windows PC, but you're struggling to connect to Wi-Fi. Whenever you try connecting, you keep seeing an error message that reads, “The Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160 MHz Driver adapter is not working.” It will sometimes state that "the driver adapter is experiencing driver or hardware-related problems.”

 If this is happening to you, let's check out the quickest ways to resolve this Intel Wi-Fi driver issue.

## 1\. Repair the Network Drivers

 In most cases, the issue at hand is caused by corrupted network drivers. To resolve it, you could either update or reinstall these drivers.

 Here are the steps for updating the network drivers:

1. Type **Device Manager** in the Start menu search bar and select the **Best match**.
2. Double-click on the **Network adapters** option.
3. Right-click your PC’s network adapter. This drive might be labeled **Intel (R) Dual Band Wireless** or something similar.
4. Click the **Update driver** option.

 If the issue persists, try resolving it by reinstalling the Network adapters.

 Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Type **Command prompt** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the **Best match** result and select **Run as administrator**.

 Finally, restart your device to apply these changes.

 It’s also likely that the issue at hand is caused by corrupted third-party apps. In this case, learning [how to perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/) could help resolve the problem.

 If a clean boot helps, then it’s clear that some of your third-party apps are the ones causing the issue. Now it's time to find those problematic apps and either remove or update them. You can identify the culprit by slowly re-enabling apps until the problem reoccurs.

## 8\. Reset Your PC

 By now, you should’ve already resolved the “Wi-Fi driver” issue. But if the problem persists, then you might want to consider resetting your PC.

 However, you should only apply this method once you've explored the other [various ways to fix Wi-Fi-related problems on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-wi-fi-problems/).

 When you reset your Windows device, the system will restore to its factory settings while keeping your data safe. However, it’s always worth backing up your device first just to be on the safe side.

 Now, here are the steps for resetting Windows:

1. Type **Settings** in the Start menu search bar and select the **Best match**.
2. Select **Update & Security** from the options.
3. Click **Recovery** on the left.
4. Click the **Get started** button on the right and then follow the on-screen steps.

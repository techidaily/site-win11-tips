## Reintroducing Versatility Beyond Win 11/10'S S Mode

### Key Takeaways

* If you cannot switch out of Windows S Mode, it may be due to issues with Microsoft servers.
* Restart the wauserv service in the Task Manager to fix any glitches with the Microsoft Update service, which handles update-related tasks on your PC.
* Try signing out of the Microsoft Store and signing back in before attempting to exit Windows S Mode again.

 Windows S Mode is a restricted version of Windows 11 and 10 where you can only install apps from the Microsoft Store, cannot access the Registry or the Group Policy Editor, and are stuck with Edge and Bing as the default browser and search engine. To install an app unavailable in the Microsoft Store, you must get out of Windows S Mode and upgrade. But sometimes, you can't switch out of the S mode because of an error.

 Try these fixes to get out of the Windows S mode for good.

## 1\. Check Microsoft Servers Status

[Windows S mode has its merits and drawbacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-s-mode-guide/); the only way to exit it is via the Microsoft Store. But if Microsoft Servers are down due to any issues, you will face issues when trying to get out of the S mode. So, check the official [Microsoft Service status](https://admin.microsoft.com/servicestatus) website or Microsoft Store's [X page](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftStore) for outage reports.

 You can also check out third-party websites like [Down Detector](https://downdetector.com/). In such a case, patiently wait while Microsoft fixes the issue. If you use a [VPN service](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-free-vpn-services-compared-which-is-fastest/) on your PC, temporarily disconnect from it and then retry exiting the S mode.

## 2\. Check the Microsoft Store Install Service

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manger.

3. Find the **wauserv** service in the list and right-click on it. Select **Restart**.

## Get Rid of Windows S Mode

 It's not difficult to solve why you can't exit the S mode on your Windows PC. Check Microsoft services, update the Microsoft Store app, and sign out and sign in again. Then, rename the SoftwareDistribution folder, reset all system apps, and do an In-place Upgrade to fix the issue if everything fails.

 Windows S Mode is a restricted version of Windows 11 and 10 where you can only install apps from the Microsoft Store, cannot access the Registry or the Group Policy Editor, and are stuck with Edge and Bing as the default browser and search engine. To install an app unavailable in the Microsoft Store, you must get out of Windows S Mode and upgrade. But sometimes, you can't switch out of the S mode because of an error.

 Try these fixes to get out of the Windows S mode for good.

## 1\. Check Microsoft Servers Status

[Windows S mode has its merits and drawbacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-s-mode-guide/); the only way to exit it is via the Microsoft Store. But if Microsoft Servers are down due to any issues, you will face issues when trying to get out of the S mode. So, check the official [Microsoft Service status](https://admin.microsoft.com/servicestatus) website or Microsoft Store's [X page](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftStore) for outage reports.

 You can also check out third-party websites like [Down Detector](https://downdetector.com/). In such a case, patiently wait while Microsoft fixes the issue. If you use a [VPN service](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-free-vpn-services-compared-which-is-fastest/) on your PC, temporarily disconnect from it and then retry exiting the S mode.

## 2\. Check the Microsoft Store Install Service

 Microsoft Update service handles all the update-related tasks on your PC. With any glitch, you must restart it to get it working again.

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manger.
2. Click on **Services**.
3. Find the **wauserv** service in the list and right-click on it. Select **Restart**.

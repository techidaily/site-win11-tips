## A Step-by-Step Approach to Repairing OneDrive on Windows 11

 With OneDrive pre-installed on Windows 11, you can seamlessly store your files online and access them. That is, of course, not possible if OneDrive runs into sync issues on your Windows 11 computer.

 If you are affected by a similar issue, don’t panic. We have compiled a list of several useful solutions that should get OneDrive to sync your files as before.

## 1\. Check the OneDrive Service Status

 Before trying anything else, you should check OneDrive's server status to make sure there's no widespread outage. You can visit [Microsoft’s service health page](https://portal.office.com/servicestatus) to check if OneDrive servers are up and running.

 If you see a red cross icon next to OneDrive, there may be nothing wrong on your end. You must wait until Microsoft resolves the issue on its end.

## 2\. Restart the OneDrive App

 This is another basic troubleshooting tip that can help resolve OneDrive sync issues on Windows 11\. Restarting the OneDrive app will take care of any temporary glitches the app may have encountered while running. If it’s nothing major, this should solve your problem.

 Follow these steps to restart the OneDrive app:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar. If you can’t find it, click the **Show hidden icons** arrow.
2. Click the **gear icon** in the top right corner of the OneDrive window and select **Pause syncing** \> **Quit OneDrive**.
3. Select the **Close OneDrive** option when the confirmation prompt appears.
4. Open the **Start menu**, type in **OneDrive** and press **Enter**.

## 3\. Check Your Account Storage Status

 It is possible that your OneDrive account has run out of storage space, which is why your files are no longer syncing. OneDrive offers 5GB of storage for free, but you may have 100GB, 1TB, or 5TB if you have upgraded or have a [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-365-basic-tier-what-you-get/).

 Follow these steps to check the available storage space in your OneDrive account:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar.
2. Click the **gear icon** and select **Settings**.
3. In the OneDrive Settings window that appears, check the storage status in the bottom left corner.  
![Check OneDrive Storage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/check-onedrive-storage.jpg)

 If your OneDrive storage is nearly full, consider deleting some of your files or upgrading your plan.

## 4\. Verify Sync Settings

 Enabling battery saver mode or [using a metered connection on your Windows 11 computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-metered-connection-wi-fi-network-windows-11/) can cause Microsoft OneDrive to stop syncing. If you don’t want that, follow these steps to modify sync settings for OneDrive:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar.
2. Click the **gear icon** and select **Settings**.
3. In the **Sync & backup** tab, turn off the toggles next to **Pause syncing when this device is in battery saver mode** and **Pause syncing when this device is on a metered network**.

## 5\. Make Sure Your Files Are Not Incompatible

 Although OneDrive allows you to sync nearly any file, there are specific restrictions and limitations regarding file types, names, sizes, and other factors. For instance, the maximum file size you can upload to OneDrive is 250GB. Microsoft periodically updates these restrictions and limitations to ensure smooth operation.

 So, if the OneDrive sync issue is limited to a select few files, refer to [Microsoft’s support page](http://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa) for information on the restrictions and limitations that apply to OneDrive files.

## 6\. Remove OneDrive Upload and Download Rate Limit

 Is OneDrive taking longer than usual to sync files despite using a fast internet connection? If so, you may have set an upload or download rate limit for OneDrive. Follow these steps to remove this limit:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar.
2. Click the **gear icon** and select **Settings**.
3. In the **Sync and backup** tab, click on **Advanced settings**.
4. Turn off the toggle for **Limit download rate** and **Limit upload rate**.

## 7\. Unlink and Link Your Account

 Authentication issues with your Microsoft account can also cause OneDrive to stop syncing. Unlinking your account and linking it again is an effective way to resolve such issues.

 Follow these steps to unlike your Microsoft account:

1. Open OneDrive settings.
2. Select **Account** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on **Unlink this PC**.
4. Select **Unlink account** to confirm.  
![Unlink OneDrive Account on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unlink-onedrive-account-on-windows.jpg)

 Once done, sign back in with your account and check if OneDrive syncs properly after that. If you encounter any error, refer to our guide for tips on [what to do when you can't sign into OneDrive on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/cant-sign-in-to-onedrive-windows/).

## 8\. Update the OneDrive App

 While OneDrive typically installs the latest app updates automatically on your Windows 11 computer, there can be times when these updates might fail. When this happens, OneDrive may exhibit unusual behavior and stop syncing. You can try updating the OneDrive app manually to see if that gets things moving again.

 Follow these steps to update the OneDrive app:

1. Open OneDrive settings.
2. Switch to the **About** tab and click the build number next to the **OneDrive version**.
3. In the webpage that opens, check the latest available OneDrive version number and compare it with the version number on your PC.
4. Click the **Download OneDrive for Windows** link if a newer version is available and install it.

## 9\. Reset or Reinstall the OneDrive App

 If updating the OneDrive app does not help or if you are already running the latest version, you can try resetting it on your Windows computer. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **OneDrive** in the search box and select **Open file location**.
3. In the File Explorer window that opens, right-click on the **OneDrive** app shortcut, and select **Copy as path**.
4. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
5. In the **Open** field, paste the file path of the OneDrive executable file, followed by **/reset** and hit **OK**.  
![Reset OneDrive](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reset-OneDrive.jpg)

 If the issue remains even after this, you can consider reinstalling the OneDrive app. To do so, open the search menu and type **OneDrive** in the text field. Click the **Uninstall** option and select **Uninstall** to confirm. Then, head over to [Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/onedrive/download) to download and install OneDrive.

## 10\. Try Basic Fixes

 If the above tips prove ineffective, you can try your luck with a few generic Windows fixes mentioned below.

* **Install Windows Updates:** OneDrive may be having sync issues due to a buggy Windows build. Try [installing any pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) and see if that resolves the problem.
* **Disable Your Antivirus Program:** Third-party antivirus programs can sometimes conflict with OneDrive and cause problems. Try disabling your antivirus program temporarily to see if that helps.
* **Check Your Internet Connection:** This one may seem obvious, but a slow or intermittent internet connection can prevent OneDrive from syncing files. It’s a good idea to rule out any Ethernet or [Wi-Fi problems on your Windows 11 computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-wi-fi-problems/).

## Sync Your OneDrive Files on Windows 11

 Even though OneDrive is a Microsoft product, it can still experience issues, just like any other app. Following the above tips should resolve any sync issues you may be having with OneDrive on your Windows 11 computer.

 Once the sync issue is resolved, it’s a good idea to take some time to familiarize yourself with some useful keyboard shortcuts for OneDrive on Windows.

 If you are affected by a similar issue, don’t panic. We have compiled a list of several useful solutions that should get OneDrive to sync your files as before.

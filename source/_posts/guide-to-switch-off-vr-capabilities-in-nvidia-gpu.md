 Nvidia GeForce Experience is now removed from your system. You won't have to worry about the overlays feature anymore.

## Why Should You Remove the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?

 The Nvidia GeForce overlay has its fair share of problems. These include jittery game detection, problematic behavior with full-screen apps, and more. If you face any of these problems, it is advisable to remove the Nvidia GeForce Experience app to see if it fixes the problem.

## Does the Nvidia GeForce Overlay Impact System Performance?

 The Nvidia GeForce Experience app does not consume a lot of system resources. The official system requirements include a two-core processor and a GTX 600 series GPU.

 However, if you have a low-end system and are running demanding games with little to no resources to spare, then the overlay can take up valuable processing power.

 If the FPS drops are minuscule, you can ignore them. Otherwise, disabling the overlay or removing the Nvidia GeForce Experience app can help squeeze a few more frames from your games.

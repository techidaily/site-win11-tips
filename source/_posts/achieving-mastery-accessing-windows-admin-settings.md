## Achieving Mastery: Accessing Windows Admin Settings

 Have you ever wanted to run the Control Panel as an administrator on Windows? Doing so can give you access to certain configuration options that would otherwise be unavailable. This article will show you how to quickly and easily open the Control Panel with administrative privileges in any Windows version. Let's get started.

## 1\. How to open the Control Panel as an Administrator through Run Command

 The Control Panel is a powerful tool for managing Windows settings and making changes to your computer. However, if you intend to use it with administrator privileges, the Run dialog box is the way to go. This is how you do it.

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** or press**Win + I** on your keyboard. The Run dialog box will open.

2. Type**control** or**control panel** in the search box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** .
3. If User Account Control (UAC) pops up on your screen, click**Yes** to allow access.

 This will open up the Control Panel with elevated privileges so that you can make changes effectively and safely. And while we're at it, did you know there are many [ways to open the Control Panel on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-control-panel/) ?

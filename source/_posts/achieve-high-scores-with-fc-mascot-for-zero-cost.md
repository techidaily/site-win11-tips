## Achieve High Scores with FC Mascot for Zero Cost

 Championship Manager 01/02 was one of the highlights of the Championship Manager series, the precursor to the Football Manager franchise.

 Eidos Interactive made Championship Manager 01/02 a freely available download from 2008, and online communities have kept this classic retro game alive and kicking ever since. This is how you can play the Championship Manager 01/02 soccer management game on a Windows 11/10 PC.

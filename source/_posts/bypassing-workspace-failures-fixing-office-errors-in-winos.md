2. Type **services.msc** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. In the Services window, scroll down to locate **Microsoft Office Click-to-Run Service** on the list. Then, double-click on it.

## 2\. Restart Your PC

 At times, Office apps may fail to open on Windows due to malfunctioning background processes or temporary glitches. In most cases, you can fix such issues by simply [restarting your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/).

 If the error persists even after a system reboot, move on to the next solution.

## 3\. Run the Office Repair Tool

 Running the Office Repair tool is an effective way to fix all kinds of issues with Office apps, including the one discussed here. Here's how you can run the tool on your PC.

1. Press **Win + S** to access the search menu.
2. Type **control panel** in the text box and press **Enter**.
3. Use the drop-down menu in the top right corner to change the view type to **Large icons**.
4. Click on **Programs and Features**.
5. Locate **Microsoft Office** on the list. Right-click on it and select **Change**.
6. Select **Yes** when the [User Account Control (UAC) prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-user-account-control-prompt/) appears.
7. Select the **Quick Repair** option and hit the **Repair** button.

 Wait for the process to complete and check if you can open your Office apps. If you still get the “Something went wrong” error, Microsoft recommends you perform an Online Repair. To do so, repeat the above steps and select the **Online Repair** option. This process may take longer to complete, but it’s most likely to fix the underlying issue.

## 4\. Uninstall and Reinstall Microsoft Office

 If running the Office repair tool proves ineffective, it's possible that some of the Office app files on your PC are corrupted. To fix this, you can try uninstalling Microsoft Office completely from your PC and installing it again. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press **Win + R** to [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/).
2. Type **appwiz.cpl** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. In the Programs and Features window, locate and select the Office product on the list.
4. Click the **Uninstall** option at the top.
5. Click **Uninstall** again to confirm, and then follow the on-screen prompts to finish removing the Office suite from your PC.

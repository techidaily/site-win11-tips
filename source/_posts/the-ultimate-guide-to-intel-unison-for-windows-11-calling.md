## The Ultimate Guide to Intel Unison for Windows 11 Calling

 Apple’s integrated ecosystem of devices makes it easy to transfer data between a mac and an iPhone. Windows users longed for this integration for many years until Microsoft launched the Phone Link app. But even that has its limitations, primarily because it is a Microsoft-owned product.

 Intel Unison is the talk of the town because it supports both iPhone and Android phones. So, you can access the phone storage, check messages and notifications, and even make calls using the Unison app. This post will share the detailed steps to make calls from your Windows 11 PC without lifting your phone.

## Why Can’t You Call Someone Directly Using Intel Unison?

 During the initial setup process of the Intel Unison app, it asks for a bunch of phone permissions. The list includes your phone storage, contacts, and messages. You must give location permissions to proceed with the app setup process. During that, the Intel Unison app also demands Bluetooth access on your phone. But why can’t it make calls?

 The reason behind this issue is that you haven’t paired your Windows 11 laptop with your phone’s Bluetooth. When you open the calls interface in the desktop app, it displays a blank screen with a message to pair with the mobile phone via Bluetooth and give access to phone contacts. So, you need to enable Bluetooth connectivity on your laptop and then pair it with the phone which has the Intel Unison app.

 The current app interface is a bit clunky, so clicking on the Show button doesn’t expand the call options. However, there is a separate tiny section that you can expand to mute calls, use a keypad, or end calls.

## The Disadvantages of Calling With Intel Unison

 When you make a call from your Windows 11 system, the app uses Bluetooth to connect and access the mobile phone. So, you have to rely on the laptop’s microphone to communicate with the person. The call experience will be better if you use a wired or wireless headset with an inbuilt microphone. If you use [dual-sim cards](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dual-sim-phones/) on your phone, you cannot choose a sim card to make the call. The app will pick whichever is the default option on the phone.

 Also, if you have a desktop, you will need to pick up a [Bluetooth adapter for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bluetooth-adapter-for-pc/) to connect and pair it with your phone. Only then you can use the calling feature in the app.

## Make Calls Without Lifting Your Phone

 Intel Unison makes it easy to access your phone contents and make calls and send text messages. It is absolutely free and works with iPhones too. So, you don’t have to use any third-party alternatives unless they offer better features and security.

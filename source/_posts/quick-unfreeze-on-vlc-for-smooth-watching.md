### **Method 2: Increase cache values in VLC Player**

 VLC Player preloads video cache files in the computer’s RAM to properly access and plays the video. You can try to fix the video buffering issue by increasing the cache value. However, this would increase the number of seconds videos are cached to play in VLC Player.

**Steps to increase cache value in VLC:**

* Open VLC Player.
* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences** .
* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.
* On the right pane, scroll down to the**Advanced** section.

### **Method 3: Disable Hardware Decoding in VLC Player**

 VLC Media Player can use the GPU of a computer to accelerate video decoding in high-quality videos. However, your PC’s drivers may behave abruptly, resulting in video playback or streaming issues. You can try disabling hardware decoding to fix Video Stuck or Freeze in the VLC player.

**Steps to disable hardware decoding in VLC:**

1. Open VLC Media Player.
2. Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences** .
3. At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* Click **Save** . Restart VLC Payer to enable the changes.

### **Method 4: Change FFmpeg settings in VLC Player**

 Making changes in the FFmpeg video codec in VLC Player has worked for some. You can also try to resolve video stuttering and freezing with this technique.

* Open VLC Media Player.
* Go to**Tools** \>**Preferences.**

* At the bottom-left corner, under**Show settings,** select ‘**All** .’

* In the left pane, click**Input/ Codecs** from the list.
* Click**Video Codecs > FFmpeg** .

* Under**FFmpeg audio/video decoder** _,_ scroll down to**Skip the loop filter for H.264 decoding** option. Set it to ‘**All** .’

* Click**Save** .

### **Method 5: Switch video output to DirectX DirectDraw in VLC**

 Try switching between output video stream settings in the VLC media player. For example, you can set the output video module to Direct 3D video output, DirectX DirectDraw, or Open GL video output.

**Steps to change video output in VLC:**

* Open**VLC** **Media Player** .
* Click and follow**Tools > Preferences** .

* In the**Preferences** window, click on**Reset Preferences.**

* In the confirmation dialog box, click**OK.**

* **Output modules** options appear on the right pane.
* View the drop-down of the**Video output module** and select**Direct 3D video output.**

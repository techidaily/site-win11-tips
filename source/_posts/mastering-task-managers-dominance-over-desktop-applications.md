## Mastering Task Manager's Dominance Over Desktop Applications

 Keeping the Task Manager on top of other windows while you’re working can be a real timesaver, helping you to stay organized and efficient. So, let's take a look at how to keep the Windows Task Manager “Always On Top" and avoid it from getting lost behind your other opened applications or windows.

 One way to keep the Windows Task Manager always on top is by making adjustments in its settings. This method is quite straightforward, and you can enable this setting with just a few clicks. Here's how:

 Right-click on Start and select**Task Manager** from the menu list. Alternatively, you can press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** on your keyboard, and it will [open the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) .

## 1\. Apply the Basic Fixes

 Over time, dirt and other particles can accumulate under the Esc key on your keyboard and prevent it from working properly. Hence, the first thing you should do is clean the Esc key gently with a brush and use a can of compressed air to blow out any dirt particles that might be trapped beneath it.

 If you are using an external keyboard, you can try disconnecting and reconnecting it. While you're at it, try a different USB port this time to determine[if there’s an issue with the USB port on your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dead-usb-port-heres-how-to-diagnose-and-fix-it/) .

 Another thing you can do is connect your keyboard to a different computer and test the Esc key. This will help you rule out any potential hardware-related issues.

## 2\. Restart Your Computer

 Restarting your computer is an age-old troubleshooting tip that can help you with a variety of issues, including this one. Doing so will give Windows and its services a fresh start, resolving any temporary glitches.

 Open the**Start menu** , click the**power icon** , and select**Restart** from the resulting menu.

## 3\. Run the Windows Troubleshooters

 Your Windows computer includes a set of troubleshooters for dealing with system-related issues. In this case, you can run the keyboard troubleshooter to see if it gets the Esc key to work again.

To run the keyboard troubleshooter on Windows:

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**troubleshoot settings** in the search box and press**Enter** .
3. Select**Other troubleshooters** .

![Run Keyboard Troubleshooter on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-keyboard-troubleshooter-on-windows.jpg)

 Wait for the troubleshooter to scan for any issues with your keyboard and fix them, then check if the Esc key works. If it does not, run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter instead. For that, use these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the Open field and press**Enter** .
3. In the Hardware and Devices window, click**Next** to run the troubleshooter.

## 4\. Turn Off Filter Keys

2. Navigate to**Accessibility > Keyboard** .
3. Turn off the toggle next to**Sticky keys** .

## 5\. Uninstall Any Key Mapping Software

 Are you using any key mapping software on your PC? If so, you need to ensure that the Esc key isn’t disabled or mapped to a different function. If it is, you can either restore the key mapping to its default or remove the key remapping software entirely. In case you need help with the latter, check our guide on[different ways to uninstall software in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .

## 6\. Run SFC and DISM Scans

 Inconsistencies with the system files on your PC can also lead to such anomalies. If the problem is being caused due to a corruption error within system files, running the SFC (System File Checker) and DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scans should help. For more information on this, check our guide on[how to repair corrupt Windows files with Windows' built-in tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) .

## 7\. Update or Reinstall Keyboard Drivers

 The keyboard driver on your computer facilitates communication between Windows and your keyboard hardware. If this driver is outdated or faulty, you're likely to encounter issues. You can try updating the keyboard drivers on your PC to see if that gets the Esc key working again.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Device Manager** from the list.
2. Double-click on**Keyboards** to expand it.
3. Right-click on your keyboard and select**Update driver** .
4. Select**Search automatically for driver** and allow Windows to update the driver.  
![Update Keyboard Driver in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/update-keyboard-driver-in-windows.jpg)

 If the Esc key does not work even after this, the keyboard driver may be corrupt. In that case, uninstall the problematic driver using Device Manager.

 Once removed, restart your PC and allow Windows to automatically reinstall the missing driver during boot.

## 8\. Install Windows Updates

## 9\. Check for Malware

 If the Esc key is still not working at this point, it’s worth ensuring that your PC isn’t infected by malware. For that, you can run a full system scan using Windows Defender or a third-party antivirus program.

 Make sure you take[the necessary steps if you discover malware on your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-steps-to-take-when-you-discover-malware-on-your-computer/) .

## 10\. Troubleshoot in Clean Boot State

 At times, background apps and services running on your computer can also conflict with Windows and prevent it from registering your keystrokes. If you suspect that to be the case, you can try using the Esc key in a clean boot state. For more information on this, check our guide on[how to perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) .

 If the Esc key works fine during a clean boot, it means one of the apps or programs is responsible for the issue. Apps and programs that you have installed fairly recently are more likely to have caused the issue.

## 11\. Perform a System Restore

 If all else fails, you can perform a system restore to revert your Windows computer to a state where the Esc key was working fine. This will allow you to undo any changes that may have caused the Esc key to stop working in Windows.

To perform a system restore on Windows, use these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command.
2. Type**sysdm.cpl** in the box and press**Enter** .
3. Under the**System Protection** tab, click the**System Restore** button.
4. Click**Next** .
5. Select a restore point before the issue first appeared and hit**Next** .
6. Click**Finish** to continue.

## Start Using the Esc Key Again on Windows

 Depending on your situation, fixing the Esc key can be as easy as cleaning it or as demanding as restoring your PC to its previous state. However, if none of the above fixes work, it’s likely that the Esc key on your keyboard is damaged and requires repair.

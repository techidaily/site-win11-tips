## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 A sketchy internet connection may prevent you from downloading or launching games from the Xbox app. Hence, before spending time on any advanced solutions,[run a quick internet speed test](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) on your PC to check your connection. You can also try switching to a different network connection if one is available.

## 2\. Correct Date and Time on Your PC

[Having your PC set to the wrong date or time](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-reasons-windows-computer-loses-time-date/) may not seem like a big deal, but it can lead to a slew of problems.

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. Select**Time & language** from the left pane.

## 4\. Reinstall the Gaming Services App

 The Gaming Services app on Windows facilitates the installation of games through the Windows Store. If the Gaming Services app is having problems, the Xbox app may redirect you to the Microsoft Store when you try to launch a game or display the error code 0x00000001.

 You can try reinstalling the Gaming Services app on Windows to see if that resolves the issue. Here's how you can go about it.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**Windows PowerShell** in the box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. In the console, paste the following command and press**Enter** to uninstall the Gaming Services app.  
`get-appxpackage Microsoft.GamingServices | remove-AppxPackage -allusers`
5. Run the following command to open the Gaming Services app page in Microsoft Store.  
`start ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9MWPM2CQNLHN`  
![Reinstall Gaming Services App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Reinstall-Gaming-Services-App.jpg)
6. Click the**Install** button to download the app.

[Restart your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) after this and try to use the Xbox app again.

## 5\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 Windows Store Apps troubleshooter is a built-in tool that can scan your apps for common issues and suggest fixes accordingly. You can use this tool if the Xbox app fails to open or work on your computer.

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Troubleshoot** .

To repair the Xbox app on Windows:

1. Right-click on the Start icon or press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Installed apps** from the list.

## 7\. Update the Xbox App

 If you haven't updated Xbox app in a while, you could encounter problems while using it. Plus, using an outdated version of the Xbox app also causes you to miss out on the latest features. Hence, it’s always a good idea to enable automatic app updates on Windows or learn[how to update Windows apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-apps-windows-11/) manually. Alternatively, you can update the Xbox app manually from the Microsoft Store.

 Launch Microsoft Store and use the search bar to locate the**Xbox** app. Click the**Update** button to install any pending updates for the Xbox app and then try to use it again.

 While you are at it, we’d also recommend you install any pending Windows updates. To do so, open the**Settings** app and head over to the**Windows Update** section. Click the**Check for updates** button and install any pending system updates on your computer. Following this, the Xbox app should work fine.

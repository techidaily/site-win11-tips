## What Does the "Unhandled Exception Has Occurred in Your Application" Error Mean?

 An exception is an unexpected event or situation when a computer program runs. Think of it as an unscheduled happening or error that interrupts whatever you're doing.

 Windows has inbuilt exception handling features whenever an error like this occurs. However, sometimes an unhandled exception occurs when a computer program or application does not properly handle exceptions.

 You can face the "unhandled exception has occurred in your application" error while working on applications or playing games. You can also experience it while opening a file or when you've just started up your PC.

 This error can occur if the .NET Framework is damaged or if there are some corrupt files or malware on your system.

 When this happens, you'll see a Microsoft .NET Framework window pop up on your PC screen, alerting you that an **"Unhandled error has occurred in your application"** . Annoyingly, this window will keep appearing even after you close it and until you've fixed the error.

 So let's explore the fixes you can try to quickly resolve this error and get back to working smoothly again.

## How to Fine-Tune Account Lockout Counter After Failed Logins on Windows 11 OS

 Enter the wrong local account password too many times and Windows could lock you out. The system also counts how many failed attempts you make when attempting to sign on to the machine.

 Exceed this threshold and you will need this counter to be reset, which you can do by waiting a set amount of time. Here’s how to change the time you must wait in order for the counter to be automatically reset.

1. Press the Windows key + R to open the **Run** dialogue.

5. Replace the number “60” in the command with any other number from one to 99,999 to set how many minutes a user will have to wait before their failed logon attempts are reset.

 A related setting, the [account lock-out duration](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-lockout-duration-windows/), must equal or exceed the time for the system to automatically reset the number of failed login attempts. If you want, you can [change the account lock-out duration on Windows](http://www.makeuseof.com/change-lockout-duration-windows/) to something that suits you best.

 You can also [limit the number of failed logon attempts on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-limit-number-failed-login-attempts-windows-10/) with a similar setting change.

## Control How Long Before the Incorrect Logon Counter Is Reset

 With this setting, you control how long before the counter that keeps track of incorrect logon attempts is reset. Use it in conjunction with the lockout duration option account policy to make things more convenient for local users.

 Exceed this threshold and you will need this counter to be reset, which you can do by waiting a set amount of time. Here’s how to change the time you must wait in order for the counter to be automatically reset.

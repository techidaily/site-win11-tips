1. Click the**Start icon** on the taskbar or press the**Win key** to open the Start menu.
2. Click the**Power icon** in the bottom right corner.
3. Select**Sleep** from the menu that appears.

## 3\. Using the Sleep Key on Your Keyboard

 Many Windows laptops and computers come with a dedicated sleep key that allows you to enter sleep mode quickly. The exact location of this key can vary depending on the make and model of your computer.

 The sleep key is usually labeled with a**crescent moon** or a**Zz** icon. You can press that key while holding the**Function** or**Fn** key to put Windows into sleep mode.

## 4\. Converting the Power Button Into a Sleep Button

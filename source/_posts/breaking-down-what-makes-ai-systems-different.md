 An AI PC is not just your average computerâ€”it's a powerhouse designed to handle artificial intelligence (AI) tasks with ease. The best part? Everything is processed directly on the deviceâ€”eliminating the need for cloud data processing.

 So, how does all this work? Unlike traditional computers, AI PCs are equipped with specialized hardware, including AI accelerators and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which boost their[machine-learning](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/machine-learning-algorithms/) capabilities.

 These computers also feature advanced software algorithms that efficiently handle data-intensive AI operations, enabling faster processing and real-time analytics. These powerful features allow AI PCs to perform tasks like natural language processing and complex data analysis much more accurately than conventional computers.

## When Will AI PCs Be Released?

 AI PCs are starting to roll out already, primarily pushed by major players like Intel and AMD. Intel has made significant strides with its Intel Core Ultra lineup, which began rolling out in December 2023\. This range includes built-in NPUs (Neural Processing Units) that enhance AI tasks on laptops.

[Intel aims to sell around 100 million AI PCs by 2025](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/what-is-an-ai-pc.html) , signaling robust growth and adoption in this sector. But your options aren't limited to just Intel, either. AMD and Qualcomm are also enhancing their CPUs with AI capabilities, and you can expect new AI PC releases from them throughout 2024.

## How Do You Easily Identify an AI PC?

 A[computer's hardware specifications](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-check-system-information/) and software capabilities define an AI PC. On the hardware side, look for mentions of NPUs, AI-specific accelerators, advanced GPUs, and higher-than-average RAM and storage specifications. These features are crucial for handling large datasets and complex algorithms. However, the simplest giveaway that a Windows computer is an AI PC is[the new Copilot key](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsofts-copilot-key-windows-11-pc/) on the keyboard.

 On the software side, AI PCs often come with pre-installed apps that leverage AI for improved functionality. This includes improved voice assistants, advanced security features like facial recognition, and apps that personalize content based on user behavior.

 Performance-wise, AI PCs demonstrate significantly better efficiency and speed in processing large volumes of data, running sophisticated simulations, and rendering high-quality graphics.

In this guide, we'll show you how to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge.

## 1\. How to Enable Advanced Graphics via Windows Settings

1. Right-click on Start and select**Settings** from the menu list. See our guide for more information on[how to access Windows Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Click**Privacy & security** in the left pane.
3. On the right, click**Windows Security** .

7. If you see a UAC prompt, click**Yes** to continue.

 After you follow the above steps, close the Settings window and restart your computer. Application Guard will now be enabled with advanced graphics support. If you ever want to turn off this feature, just follow the same steps and turn off Advanced graphics.

## 2\. How to Enable Advanced Graphics via Registry Editor

 If you don't like the idea of tinkering with the Windows Settings page, you can also use the Registry Editor to enable advanced graphics in Application Guard for Edge. But keep in mind that tweaking the Windows Registry is a risky endeavor, so proceed carefully. To be safe,[back up your registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making any changes.

2. Type**regedit** in the dialog box and hit Enter.
3. Click Yes on the UAC prompt to open Registry Editor.

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Hvsi
5. Double-click**EnableVirtualGPU** in the right pane.

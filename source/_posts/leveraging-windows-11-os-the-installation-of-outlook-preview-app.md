## Leveraging Windows 11 OS: The Installation of Outlook Preview App

 Millions of users have trusted Microsoft Outlook for over two decades, and to ensure its continuity, Microsoft has introduced the Outlook preview app with innovative features and a fresh look.

 Read on as we explain what the Outlook preview app is and how you can get it too.

## What Is the Outlook Preview App?

 The preview version of Outlook aims to help users work more efficiently through a rich design and new features that boost productivity and usability. Microsoft has revamped the Outlook experience by making it modern, sleek, and functional. New features allow smart Google calendar integration, and users can even use Skype and Microsoft Teams straight from the Outlook app.

 The Microsoft Outlook preview app is available to [Microsoft 365](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-office-365-rename/) Insider program participants. Users who have signed up to be an ‘Insider’ are the first to receive the latest updates for their favorite Office apps. Microsoft relies on the feedback collected from the Insider community to improve features, fix bugs, and enhance user experience.

 You can visit the [official Microsoft 365 Insider website](https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/join/windows) to learn more about the Microsoft 365 Insider program.

 If you want to experience the Outlook preview app without signing up for the Insider program, you can do so through the official Windows Mail and Calendar apps.

## How to Switch to the Outlook Preview App via Microsoft Outlook

 If you have a valid Microsoft 365 subscription and are already part of the Insider program, you can switch to the Outlook preview app from the classic Outlook for Windows app. The Insider program is only available to users who either have a Microsoft 365 Family or Personal subscription.

 If you have a Business or Student subscription, your workplace administrator will have to register for the Insider program. I recommend joining the Insider**Current Channel (Preview)** rather than the**Beta Channel** , as it’s less prone to bugs and issues.

 Once you’ve registered your device and Microsoft account with the Microsoft 365 Insider program, you’ll be eligible for the latest updates to Microsoft 365 apps (this includes being eligible for the Outlook preview app).

To get the Outlook preview app through Outlook for Windows app:

1. Launch**Outlook** from the**Start** menu.
2. Add an email account if you haven’t already done so.
3. From the top-right corner, toggle the**Try the new Outlook** button.
4. Wait for Outlook to reload, and you’ll now have access to the all-new Outlook preview app.

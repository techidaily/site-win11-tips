## Who Needs Third-Party Photo Slideshow Software?

 So, it’s hardly essential to install third-party slideshow software in Windows 11 when you can show off your favorite pics with the methods above. Windows 11’s built-in desktop and screensaver slideshow features and Google Photos are ok for showcasing basic image collections. You can set up more advanced photography slideshows that incorporate variable transition effects, background music, audio narrative, and text captions with Video Editor and Google Sheets.

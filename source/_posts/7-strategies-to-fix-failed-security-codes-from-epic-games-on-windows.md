## 7 Strategies to Fix Failed Security Codes From Epic Games on Windows

 Epic Games Launcher is the go-to place to download some of the most popular games like GTA 5, Fall Guys, Rocket League, and more. However, for many users, the launcher fails to send the security code necessary for account verification. This issue can be frustrating as it prevents users from playing games downloaded to their account.

 As such, if Epic Games Launcher fails to send the security code, then try the below fixes to troubleshoot the problem for good.

## 1\. Check Your Login Credentials

 Oftentimes, users enter incorrect login credentials and start wondering why they haven't received the security code in their inbox. Thus, make sure you are entering the correct username and password and that your caps lock key is not on. You may also reset your password if unsure if it is correct.

## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 You must be connected to a stable and reliable internet connection to receive the security code in your inbox. To check your internet stability and speed, use an [internet speed testing website](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) .

 If the result shows your connection is weak or unstable, try [restarting your router](https://www.makeuseof.com/reboot-router-correct-way/) . You can also do many other things to [improve your internet speed](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-increase-internet-speed/) .

## 3\. Is the Epic Games Server Down?

![Server status page of Epic Games Launcher](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/server-status-page.jpg)

 Epic Games Launcher might fail to send the security code if its server is under maintenance or facing downtime. To confirm if that's what is causing the issue, visit [Epic Games Launcher server status website](https://status.epicgames.com/) . Alternatively, you check [Epic Games Launcher Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/EpicGames) to know about any ongoing server issues.

 If servers are under maintenance or facing downtime, you can't do much other than wait until they become operational again.

## 4\. Disable Your VPN

 VPN allows you to access all those websites that are blocked in your area. But a VPN connection can also make your connection unstable and stop the Epic Games Launcher from sending the security code.

So, disable any active VPN and check if it fixes the issue.

## 5\. Switch to a Google Public DNS

![Configuring the Google Public DNS in the Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-public-dns.jpg)

 Another reason behind the issue can be your PC's unreliable DNS server. The solution here is to switch to Google public DNS.

 You can change your DNS server settings in the Control Panel. Check out our guide on [changing the DNS server on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-dns-settings-windows-11/) for detailed instructions. You'll have to enter**8.8.8.8** in preferred and**8.8.4.4** in the alternate DNS box to change to the Google Public DNS.

## 6\. Update Your Network Drivers

## Utilizing NAS on Smartphones and Tablets

 If you searched for ways to access your Windows files from your Android/iOS devices, chances are you landed on guides suggesting you to download all sorts of external applications, free or paid. Did you know that you absolutely don't need any external application for file transfers across your devices? Well, now you do. Windows Network Share is a really easy way of sharing files, folders, or entire drives across devices on the same network. Let's learn how to set up Windows Network Share to access your PC files from Android/iOS.

## What Is Network File Sharing?

 When you want to share a file or folder with someone, sometimes it is faster to share it over your local network, rather than uploading to the cloud or looking for a USB flash drive. This process is called network file sharing. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is also a valid option for file sharing remotely or on the local network but, it's much more of a hassle to set up than Windows Network Share.

 Windows Network Share utilizes the SMB protocol internally to make files, directories, or, entire drives available for read/write access for devices on the local network. While it's super easy and swift to set up, it's also a common target for adversaries. So, it's wise that you learn [how the SMB protocol works and some common SMB vulnerabilities](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-smb-protocol-and-what-are-its-risks/) to ensure that your network perimeter isn't breached.

## How to Share a Windows Drive on Your Local Network

 To access your computer's files, you need to share them on the local network. For the demonstration, I'll be sharing a drive on the local network. If you wish to share a folder or a single file instead, you can follow the same steps but with only the folder(s) and file(s) selected.

 Before you dive into the steps, it's recommended you [create a separate, local Windows user account](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-local-user-account/) to be used solely for network drive access.

 Here are the steps to share files on the local network in Windows 10/11:

1. **Right-click** on the drive you want to share.
2. From the drop-down menu, click on **Properties**.
3. In the **Properties** menu, go to the **Sharing** tab.  
![sharing tab open in properties menu of a drive-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sharing-tab-open-in-properties-menu-of-a-drive-1.jpg)
4. Click on **Advanced Settings** in the new pop-up menu, check the **Share this folder** box, and wait, it's not over yet. Now to prevent unsolicited access to your locally shared drives, click on **Permissions**.
5. In the new menu that pops up, click on **Add**. Yet another box should pop up. Here, type in the username of your user account. Use a dedicated user account only for network access or use your primary account's username and press **Enter**. You should find your name is present on the list of users with permission to the shared drive.

6. Finally, click on your account name, and in the **Permissions for <account name>** section, check the **Full Control** box and hit **Apply**.

## How to Access Your Windows Files From an Android Device

 Now that you have shared the drive on the local network you'll be able to access your newly shared drives and files from your Android device in just a few taps. Make sure your Android device and Windows PC are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. With these checks out of the way, let's look at the steps to access Windows network shared files from Android:

1. Fire up the **Files** application on your Android device.
2. On the **Files** application, scroll to **Network Storage** and tap on it.
3. Inside **Network Storage**, tap on **Add network storage**. You might be asked to select an option from a list of protocols. Tap on **Network Drive** or any option with **SMB** in the name.
4. Your device will start to scan for locally shared drives. Wait for it to locate your Windows drive. If your device is unable to locate it follow the next steps. First, you need to [find the IP address of your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/find-ip-mac-address-windows-powershell/).
5. After noting the IP address, go back to your Android device and tap on **Add Manually**.
6. In the new window, type in the IPv4 address you copied earlier into the Address field. Then, type **445** into the **Port** field. Finally, fill in the **Username** and **Password** fields with your account credentials and hit on **Add** or **Connect**.

## Unlocking Error #0X80131500 on Microsoft Shop

 The Microsoft Store is an effective means to access the latest and most popular apps for your Windows machine. However, some users enter a predicament when they see the error code 0x80131500 after opening the Microsoft Store app.

 They cannot access the store and see the “**This page could not be loaded. Please try again later.**” message along with the error code listed below. If you face the same issue, don’t worry. We will list out the possible reasons for this Microsoft error code along with potential fixes.

## What Are the Causes Behind the Microsoft Store Error Code 0x80131500?

 Here are some possible reasons for the Microsoft Store app being unable to load the page.

1. Your computer doesn’t have a working internet connection.
2. There are corrupt or missing Microsoft Store files.
3. You are using an outdated version of the Microsoft Store.
4. The system time and date are out of sync.

 Now, you know the possible reasons for the error code. Let’s jump into the solutions to restore the Microsoft Store app to its normal working condition.

## 1\. Terminate and Reopen the Microsoft Store App

 Apps can glitch anytime. They may not be able to work properly unless you terminate the app and relaunch them. Here’s how to terminate and reopen the Microsoft Store app.

1. Press **Win + I** to launch the Settings app on your system.
2. Navigate to **Apps > Installed apps**.
3. Locate the Microsoft Store app in the list and click on the **three dots**. Select the **Advanced options** option.

 Wait for the system to restart and then connect it to a working internet connection. Then, launch the Microsoft Store.

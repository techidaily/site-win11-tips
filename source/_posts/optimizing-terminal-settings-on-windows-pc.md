## Optimizing Terminal Settings on Windows PC

 If you find the default terminal emulator on your Windows PC—Windows Console Host—to be too basic and lacking in features, there are a few good alternatives. These alternative apps, like Windows Terminal, offer several advanced features like tabs, profiles, the ability to open multiple windows, and more.

 Setting a terminal as the default app for Command Prompt and PowerShell is fairly straightforward. Here are some methods you can use to make the switch.

## 1\. How to Change the Default Terminal App via Windows Terminal's Settings

 The most straightforward way to change the default command-line interface on your Windows computer is by using Windows Terminal's settings menu. Here are the steps you can follow.

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Terminal** in the search box and press **Enter** (see [how to open the Windows Terminal](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-windows-terminal/) for more methods).
3. Click the **down-arrow icon** at the top and select **Settings** from the resulting menu.
4. Use the drop-down menu next to **Default terminal application** to select your chosen terminal from the list.
5. Optionally, you can set the **Default profile** that opens when you launch the Terminal app.
6. Click the **Save** button at the bottom.

 If you want to undo the above changes later, simply repeat the above steps and select **Windows console host** or **Let Windows decide** in the **Default terminal application** drop-down menu.

 Alternatively, you can also reset the Terminal app on your PC. If you are interested in doing that, check our guide on [how to reset the Windows Terminal settings to their defaults in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-reset-terminal-settings/).

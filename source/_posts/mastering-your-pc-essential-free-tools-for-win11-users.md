## Mastering Your PC: Essential Free Tools for Win11 Users

 Windows 11 comes with plenty of new features, thus reducing the dependency on third-party apps for minor tweaks. However, like any other operating system, third-party apps help extend the OS's functionality to a great extent.

 For example, Windows 11 has a built-in ZIP file extractor, but a third-party app like 7-Zip provides advanced file compression features. Similarly, Adobe Express and Lightroom offer advanced image and video editing features compared to the built-in Video Editor and Photos app.

 Here we have collected a list of free tools for Windows 11 that average and advanced users will benefit from in their day-to-day tasks.

## 1\. QuickLook
![quick look windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/quick-look-windows-11.jpg)

 Windows 11 lets you view the large thumbnail of images in File Explorer. However, it still lacks a preview feature if you want a glance at your files without opening them in the Photos app.

 QuickLook can fix this problem. It is a third-party utility on Microsoft Store that lets you view the preview of images, icons, and documents such as PDFs with the help of the spacebar.

 To view a preview, highlight an image and then press the spacebar. Press again to close the preview. The preview dialog offers more options to pin the preview, open the image in a different app and keep the preview on top.

## 2\. 7-Zip
![7zip windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7zip-windows-11.jpg)

 Windows 11 comes with a rudimentary archive file extraction feature. However, if you need wide support for various file formats, 7-Zip is an excellent alternative. It is an open-source file compression utility and is easy to use.

 Additional features include AES-256 encryption support, a command line version, and multi-language support. It also acts like a file manager where you can move and copy files and even delete them from the app's interface.

## 3\. Microsoft PowerToys
![notepad plus plus windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/notepad-plus-plus-windows-11.jpg)

 Microsoft PowerToys consists of a bunch of advanced utilities for Windows users. It is an essential utility that you must install on your new PC to do more with Windows 10 and 11.

 You can access all the features in the Tab mode. For example, the**Always on Top** feature lets you pin active windows on top in floating mode. Then there is an [Awake option to keep your PC awake indefinitely](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-sleep-mode-windows/) , irrespective of your selected power plan. We covered this in more detail in our guide on [how to temporarily disable sleep mode on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-sleep-mode-windows/) .

 You can also use it to perform keyboard mapping, some mouse customization, view shortcut guide for Windows apps and settings, a built-in Color Picker, and more.

 We have covered this utility in detail in our guide on [how to use Microsoft PowerToys for Windows 10 and 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-powertoys/) .

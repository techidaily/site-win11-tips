1. Go to the**Accounts** section.
2. Move to the right pane and click**Your info** .
3. Under**Related settings** , click**Manage my accounts** . This will take you to the "Manage accounts" page.

## 3\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through Command Prompt

 If you prefer using the Command Prompt instead of the Settings app or Control Panel, you can also change your Microsoft account administrator name through it. This is a command line interpreter tool that allows you to control your Windows computer system with instructions.

 To change the Microsoft account administrator name through Command Prompt, follow these steps:

1. [Run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. In the elevated command prompt, type the following command:  
`wmic useraccount where fullname='userame' rename 'newname'`

 In the above command, replace**username** with the current administrator name and**newname** with what you want to set as your new name. For example, if you want to change the administrator name from Paul to Michael, your command will look like this:

 **wmic useraccount where fullname='Paul' rename 'Michael'**

 Press**Enter** to apply the changes. Your Microsoft account administrator name has been successfully changed. You can now sign in with your new Microsoft account administrator.

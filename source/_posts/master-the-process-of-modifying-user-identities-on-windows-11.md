## Master the Process of Modifying User Identities on Windows 11

 When you initially configure a Windows computer with a Microsoft account, you will be asked to create an administrator name. This is the profile that grants access to make administrative changes on the device.

 But if you ever decide to alter this username, there are different options available for doing so. This tutorial will show you how to change the Microsoft account administrator name in Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through System Settings

 The Settings app is a built-in application on Windows that allows you to customize and manage settings on your computer. To change the Microsoft account administrator name in Windows 11,[open the System Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) and follow these steps:

1. Go to the**Accounts** section.
2. Move to the right pane and click**Your info** .
3. Under**Related settings** , click**Manage my accounts** . This will take you to the "Manage accounts" page.

4. Sign in with the Microsoft account you need to change the name of.
5. After signing in, click**Your info** option from the top section.
6. Under your Profile photo, you'll see your name. Click the**Edit name** option and enter your new name.

7. To ensure that you are a real person and not an automated program, type the characters in the Captcha field.
8. Click the**Save** changes button, and you're all set.

 Your Microsoft account administrator name has been successfully changed.

## 2\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through Control Panel

 The Control Panel is a graphical user interface (GUI) in Microsoft Windows that you can use to change your computer's hardware and software features.

 To change the Microsoft account administrator name on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Click on Start and search for Control Panel. Select the Control Panel option to open it.
2. In the Control Panel window, scroll down and click**User Accounts** .
3. On the right side of the page, click the**Change your account name** link.

4. Enter the new name and click**Change Name** .

 Your Microsoft account administrator name will now be changed. Now you can access all the services provided by Windows with your new name.

## 3\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through Command Prompt

 If you prefer using the Command Prompt instead of the Settings app or Control Panel, you can also change your Microsoft account administrator name through it. This is a command line interpreter tool that allows you to control your Windows computer system with instructions.

 To change the Microsoft account administrator name through Command Prompt, follow these steps:

1. [Run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. In the elevated command prompt, type the following command:  
`wmic useraccount where fullname='userame' rename 'newname'`

 In the above command, replace**username** with the current administrator name and**newname** with what you want to set as your new name. For example, if you want to change the administrator name from Paul to Michael, your command will look like this:

 **wmic useraccount where fullname='Paul' rename 'Michael'**

 Press**Enter** to apply the changes. Your Microsoft account administrator name has been successfully changed. You can now sign in with your new Microsoft account administrator.

## 4\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through Run Command

 Another tool you can use to change the Microsoft account administrator name is the Run dialog command. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** from the menu list.
2. In the Run dialog box, type**netplwiz** and press Enter. This will open the User Accounts window.
3. Select the Microsoft account you want to change and click**Properties** .

4. Under the**General** tab, enter the new name in the**Full Name** field.
5. Click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.

Your Microsoft account administrator name is now changed.

## 1\. Check How Much Space Your Apps or Programs Are Using via the Settings App

 The Storage section within the Settings app gives you a complete breakdown of the disk space occupied by the system, apps, media files, and more. To find out how much space your apps are using, use these steps:

1. Press **Win + I** or use one of [the many ways to launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Navigate to **System > Storage** and look for the **Installed apps** section to check the total storage occupied by your apps.
3. Click on **Installed apps** to check the storage used by each of your apps. Use the drop-down menu next to **Sort by** to arrange apps based on their size.

 If you want to check the storage usage of apps on a specific drive, click the drop-down menu next to **Filter by** and choose the desired drive.

## 2\. Check How Much Space Your Apps or Programs Are Using via the Control Panel

 Although Microsoft is gradually transitioning from the Control Panel to the modern Settings app, the Control Panel still remains accessible in all versions of Windows, including Windows 11\. So, if you prefer using the Control Panel, use these steps to check how much storage your apps or programs are using on Windows.

1. Click the **magnifying icon** on the taskbar to open the search menu.
2. Type **control panel** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. Use the drop-down menu in the top right corner to change the view type to **Large icons**.
4. Click on **Programs and Features** to view a list of programs installed on your computer. You can check the **Size** column to find out how much space a program is using.

## 3\. Check How Much Space Your Apps or Programs Are Using via File Explorer

 Although the Settings app and Control Panel make it easy to check the storage usage of your apps and programs, they might not provide storage information for all desktop apps. To check the storage usage of such programs, you will have to [use the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-file-explorer-tips/). Here are the steps you can follow.

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** and select **File Explorer** from the list.
2. Use the left pane to navigate to **This PC**.
3. Open the drive where you have installed Windows (typically the C drive).
4. Navigate to the **Program Files** or **Program Files (x86)** folder, and then scroll through the list until you find the program for which you want to check storage usage. Right-click on it and select **Properties**.
5. Under the **General** tab, look for the **Size** and **Size on disk** entries to check how much storage the program is using.

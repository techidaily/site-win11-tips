## 2\. Create a Command Prompt Desktop Shortcut

1. Right-click on your desktop and select**New > Shortcut** .  
![Create Command Prompt Desktop Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/create-command-prompt-desktop-shortcut.jpg)
2. Copy and paste the following into the location box then click**Next** .  
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
3. Name the shortcut Command Prompt Admin or something similar and then click**Finish** to save it.
4. Right-click on the Command Prompt shortcut icon and select**Properties** from the menu that appears.  
![Run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/run-command-prompt-as-an-administrator.jpg)
5. Then select the**Advanced option** in the resulting window.
6. Check the**Run as administrator** box, then click**OK** to save your changes.

 Once you performed the above steps, double-click on Command Prompt Admin to open Command Prompt as an administrator.

 Now that Command Prompt is running as an administrator, you don't have to worry about Command Prompt not working correctly.

 If it prevents you from creating a shortcut for Command Prompt, you may have to create a new user account. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel. Check out[how to open the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) if you get stuck.  
![Manage another account using Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/manage-another-account-using-control-panel.jpg)
2. Then navigate to**User Accounts > Manage Another Account** .  
![Add a new user in PC settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/add-a-new-user-in-pc-settings.jpg)
3. From here, click on the**Add a new user in PC settings** link and follow the steps to create a new user account with administrative privileges.

 Once you have your new admin account set up, log in with it and launch Command Prompt again as an administrator - this should fix the issue. When you still can't get it to run, try restarting your computer before trying any of the other solutions listed here.

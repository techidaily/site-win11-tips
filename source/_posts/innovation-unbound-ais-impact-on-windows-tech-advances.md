![Screenshot of Google Chrome on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-google-chrome-on-macos.JPG)

 There is no doubt that AI has greatly improved search functionality on applications, web browsers, and even Windows’ search bar.

 AI can understand natural language queries and respond with relevant results. This enables users to search for files, folders, and applications using normal language instead of specific keywords. It can also suggest queries based on search history and current context, enabling users to save time by choosing a suggested search query instead of typing one out themselves.

 Moreover, AI can learn from users' search behavior to provide more accurate and relevant search results over time. As a consequence, searches become more personalized and useful as users continue to search for content.

 Ultimately, Windows employs artificial intelligence to analyze and index the contents of files and folders to provide more accurate search results. This feature allows users to search for specific content within files, such as a keyword in a document or a specific image in a folder.

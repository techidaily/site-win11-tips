## Focused File Exploring: Unleash Windowed Space Potential

 Windows 11 has introduced many new features to its File Explorer, one of which is the Compact View. This feature is primarily for users who preferred the previous File Explorer interface, which had less space between items.

 So, we'll share three ways you can enable the compact view in File Explorer on Windows 11\.

## 1\. Enable Compact View in File Explorer Using the Command Bar

 The easiest way to enable or disable the compact view in File Explorer is to use the command bar. Here's what you need to do:

1. [Open the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and click the **View** option in the top bar.
2. Choose the **Compact view** option to enable it.

## 2\. Enable Compact View in File Explorer Using Folder Options

 If the compact view option is missing in the command bar, you can use Folder options to get the work done. There are [multiple ways to open the Folder option](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-open-folder-options/), but the quickest is to use the Run dialog box.

 Open the **Run dialog box** by pressing the **Win + R** hotkeys, type **control folders,** and press Enter to open the Folder option.

 Alternatively, in the Run dialog box, you can type

**rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Options_RunDLL 0**

 and click **OK** to launch the Folder option.

## 3\. Enable Compact View in File Explorer Using the Registry Editor

![Enabling Compact view in the Registry Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/enabling-compact-view.jpg)

 Registry files on your system contain important settings for Windows. If you're an advanced Windows user, you can enable the compact view in File Explorer using the Registry Editor.

 Note that editing the registry is risky. So, before getting into the below steps, make sure to [back up your registry files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) or [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/).

1. Press the **Win + S** hotkeys to open the **search menu.**
2. Type **regedit** in the box and choose the **Run as administrator** option.
3. Click **Yes** to the UAC that appears.
4. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
5. Search for and double-click on the **UseCompactMode** entry in the right pane.
6. Type **1** in **Value data** and click OK. This will enable the Compact View. To disable, type **0** in the **Value data** and click **OK.**

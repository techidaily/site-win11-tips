## Reactivation Guide for Your Frozen Windows 11 Search Box

 Windows 11 Settings app is stuffed with plenty of control options. And there are high chances that you might get lost in so many options. In such scenarios, the Search strip in the Settings app comes in handy, as it helps you find the exact control quickly in the Settings app.

 But what if the Search is not working in the Settings app? In this article, we are putting together a list of fixes you can try when Search is not working in Windows 11 Settings app.

## 1\. Restart Your Device ![Restart Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/restart-windows-11-edit.jpg)

 A restart can fix many issues that are plaguing your system. When you restart your PC, you are essentially instructing it to start with a clean slate, leaving behind issues that might be causing trouble. Restarting your PC can also fix the Search issue in the Settings app.

 However, if your PC frequently requires a restart to fix this issue, the underlying problem affecting the Search feature in the Settings app persists. In that case, you should look for a more robust solution.

## 2\. Install All the Latest Windows Updates ![Windows 11 Update setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/windows-update-edit.jpg)

 Besides new features, software updates are meant to improve performance by fixing issues impacting your PC. While it can happen to anyone, a dysfunctional Search can be pretty common if you are running a Windows 11 Insider build. Either way, if you are seeing a software update on the**Windows Update** page in the Settings app, you should install it to see if it fixes the issue.

 Search indexing is the process in which your PC looks at files, folders, and other content that are there in the system. Getting errors while searching for specific settings could be the result of the malfunctioning of the Search indexing. If the above solutions do not fix the Search issue, you should run this troubleshooter from the Settings app. You can run it by following the below steps:

1. Open the**Settings** app by pressing**Win + I** on your keyboard.
2. Go to**System** \>**Troubleshoot** \>**Other troubleshooters** .
3. Scroll down until you find**Search and Indexing** .
4. Click**Run** , which is on the right side of**Search and Indexing** .

 The troubleshooter will look for the root cause of the issue and offer you solutions. Now, follow the fixes it recommends and see if the problem is gone.

 You can troubleshoot whatever is causing the Search issue in the Settings app by resetting or repairing it. A reset will take the Settings app to a normal state, though the app data will be deleted. On the other hand, if you repair the app, your system will look for what's causing the problem and try to fix it without deleting app data.

To reset or repair the Settings app, follow the below steps:

1. Click the Start icon and type "Settings."
2. Right-click on**Settings** , and then click**App settings** .

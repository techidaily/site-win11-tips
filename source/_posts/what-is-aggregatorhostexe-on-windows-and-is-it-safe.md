## What Is the "AggregatorHost.exe" Process in Windows?

 AggregatorHost.exe is a Windows background process that operates discreetly. This process is a component of the Windows Insider Program, designed for the testing of forthcoming features and updates before their public release.

 The primary function of this process is to collect user feedback and telemetry data from participants in the Windows Insider Program, forwarding this information to Microsoft for analysis. Some users have also observed its connection with changes in Windows Defender.

 Under normal circumstances, this file should reside in the "C:\\Windows\\System32" directory and carry a valid digital signature from Microsoft Corporation.

 While AggregatorHost.exe is a legitimate component, it's important to note that some malicious programs may attempt to masquerade as AggregatorHost.exe to evade detection within your system. This can lead to potentially harmful consequences, as these impostor files may contain malware capable of causing damage to your system.

## How to Check the Authenticity of AggregatorHost.exe on Windows

 If you think the AggregatorHost.exe file on your PC might not be authentic, here's how to check:

* **Verify the location**: Launch the Task Manager by pressing **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ **Esc** keys together. Locate the AggregatorHost.exe process in the list and right-click on it. Select **Open file location** from the menu. The genuine AggregatorHost.exe file should be located in "C:\\Windows\\System32" folder. If you find it hidden somewhere unknown, it can be a malicious program.

* **Check the file properties**: Right-click on the "AggregatorHost.exe" file and choose **Properties** from the context menu. Head over to the "Details" or "Version" tab and look for information about the file, such as its version, copyright, and product name. Legitimate system files usually have detailed information.
* **Check the Digital Signature**: In the Properties dialog of the file, open the "Digital Signatures" tab (if it is available) or check the details of the file to verify the digital signature. A legitimate file should have a digital signature that is both valid and trusted. If the digital signature is invalid or not from a trusted source, it may be a cause for concern.
* **Look for publisher information**: You can also look for information about the publisher or company that created the file. Legitimate system files are typically signed by well-known companies like Microsoft.

## When Should You Disable AggregatorHost.exe?

 While this program generally operates in the background without disturbances, occasional issues may arise. These issues typically manifest as high CPU usage or uncertainty regarding the process's legitimacy.

 Disabling the process is a straightforward procedure. To do so, access the Task Manager and locate the process in question. Select it, then click on the **Disable** button, and confirm your action when prompted for confirmation.

 To fix the issues that this file has caused, here are some solutions that you can try:

* **Run an antivirus scan**: If you suspect that "AggregatorHost.exe" is related to malware or other malicious activity, scan your system using any of the [reputable antivirus or antimalware programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-antivirus-for-windows-10/) available and follow the recommendations provided.

This can be best done using the [System File Checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/), which will check the integrity of your system files.

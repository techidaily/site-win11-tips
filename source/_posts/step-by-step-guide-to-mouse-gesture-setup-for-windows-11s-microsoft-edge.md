## How to Enable Mouse Gestures in Microsoft Edge

 Adding mouse gestures to Microsoft Edge is a simple process. You just need to [ensure you have the latest Edge update installed](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-chrome-firefox-edge-desktop-mobile/) on your computer.

 Once you've done that, follow these steps to enable mouse gestures in Edge:

1. Launch Edge, click the **three dots** at the top-right corner, and choose **Settings** from the context menu.
2. Choose **Appearance** from the left sidebar, and turn on the toggle next to **Enable Mouse Gesture**.

 And that's about it. The mouse gestures feature is now enabled in Edge.

 You can also customize mouse gesture settings. To do this, select the **Configure Mouse Gestures** option and set the action of each gesture. Remember that [Windows 11 comes with its own touchpad gestures](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-touchpad-gesture-guide/), so if you're on a laptop, make sure the two don't overlap.

 For example, if you want Edge to open a new window when you swipe from right to left, click the drop-down arrow next to the **Right** option and select **New window**.

 The mouse gesture feature has two other options: **Show Mouse Track** and **Show Action Hint**. The first option shows the path of your mouse movement, and the second option provides visual cues for gesture-based actions.

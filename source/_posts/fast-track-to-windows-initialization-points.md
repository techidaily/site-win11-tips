## Fast Track to Windows' Initialization Points

 The Startup folder determines which programs automatically launch upon starting your computer. If you're not okay with certain programs launching at startup or want to add a few of your own, you can do it in the Startup folder.

 However, finding the Startup folder isn't that simple. It's buried deep within your system files, which often requires an in-depth search. In this guide, we explore how to quickly find and access the Startup folder on Windows. Let's see how to open the Startup folder.

## 1\. How to Access Startup Folder Using the Run Command

 The Run command gives you quick access to various system functions and saves time navigating system menus. To open the Startup folder using the Run command, follow these steps:

1. [Open the Run command window](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/).
2. Type **Shell:startup** in the search field and click **OK**.

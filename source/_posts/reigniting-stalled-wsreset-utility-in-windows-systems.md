## How to Fix WSReset.exe Not Working on Windows

 Before you troubleshoot, let's see what WSReset.exe is used for. The WSReset.exe program resets Windows Store and clears any cache issues that might cause errors. It troubleshoots problems with the Windows Store and applications, including those that are not downloading or launching properly.

 Now let's move on to troubleshooting.

## 1\. Run WSReset.exe as an Administrator

 WSReset.exe requires administrative privileges to run properly. If you're not running it as an administrator, it may fail to reset the Windows Store cache.

## 2\. Run the Windows Store App Troubleshooter

 This problem also appears due to corrupt system files or Windows Store application issues. To fix these issues, Windows offers an embedded troubleshooter that identifies and resolves problems with the Store app.

 To run the troubleshooter, use the steps below.

2. Select **System** from the left sidebar.

 If you use Windows 10 version, the process will be slightly different. Press **Win + R**, type **ms-settings:troubleshoot**, and hit Enter. In the Settings menu, click **Update & Security** \> **Troubleshoot** \> **Additional troubleshooters**.

## 4\. Remove the Latest Windows Updates

 Although Microsoft releases regular Windows updates to improve overall system performance, sometimes these updates cause problems instead. WSReset.exe not working is one such issue related to a recent Windows update.

6. Click **Uninstall** again when prompted.

 Follow the onscreen instructions and restart your computer when it's done.

## 5\. Clear the Microsoft Store Cache via the Registry

 If you're still having issues with WSReset.exe, clear the Microsoft Store cache via the registry. This wipes out temporary files, settings, or preferences that may cause this issue.

 It is a complex process for those unfamiliar with registry changes, as incorrect settings could cause major problems. However, if done correctly, this flushes the cache and solves WSReset.exe errors. To avoid data loss, back up your registry and be cautious when modifying it.

4. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`wmic useraccount get name,sid`
5. Running this command will list all user accounts on your computer. Find the SID of your user account and copy it.  
![List all user account via command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/list-all-user-account-via-command-prompt.jpg)

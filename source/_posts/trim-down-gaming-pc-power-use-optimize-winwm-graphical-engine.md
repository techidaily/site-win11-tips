## What Causes the Desktop Windows Manager's High GPU Usage on Windows?

 Before getting into the solutions, it's crucial to understand the root causes behind this issue. While the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) may consume a significant amount of GPU resources for various reasons, the most common ones are listed below:

* Outdated or corrupted graphics card drivers often stand as the primary cause of excessive GPU consumption by the Desktop Window Manager.
* [Hardware acceleration](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-hardware-acceleration/) on third-party applications can increase the burden on your GPU, ultimately leading to the issue at hand.
* Your computer's HDR display settings could also be a reason behind the high GPU consumption by the Desktop Window Manager.

 Now that you know the potential culprits, let's check out the methods to rectify them.

## 1\. Update Your Graphics Driver

 We cannot stress enough the importance of regularly updating your graphics driver. An updated graphics driver ensures your system remains immune to graphics-related issues and provides you access to the latest features from your GPU manufacturer.

 To update the graphics driver, open the **Settings app** (see how to [launch Settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/)), choose **Windows Update** from the left sidebar, and click the **Check for updates** button.

 Windows will not search for any available updates for all the installed components, including the graphics driver. If it finds any, it will automatically download it without much user input.

![Check for updates option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/check-for-updates-1.jpg)

 Alternatively, you have the option to directly download the latest update for your graphics driver from the manufacturer's website.

* [Download Intel Drivers](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)
* [Download AMD Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Download Nvidia Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)

 Upon successfully updating the graphics driver, restart your computer and check if the DWM GPU consumption is back to normal.

## 2\. Turn Off Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling is a handy Windows feature that reduces the CPU workload by allocating graphics-intensive tasks to the GPU. While this feature typically operates well, there are instances when it might lead to unintended consequences, particularly on systems with weak GPUs.

 Enabling GPU scheduling on a weak GPU could result in latency issues and high GPU consumption by various processes, including the Desktop Window Manager. Consequently, you can [disable GPU scheduling](https://www.makeuseof.com/hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling-disable-windows/) if you face graphics-related problems on your PC subsequent to its activation.

## 3\. Configure the NVIDIA Control Panel Settings

 Desktop Windows Manager's high GPU consumption issue also stems from your NVIDIA GPU's incorrect power management settings. To resolve this, you'll need to access the NVIDIA Control Panel and use it to configure your GPU's power consumption. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Press **Win** to open the Start Menu, type **NVIDIA Control Panel** in the search bar, and press **Enter**.
2. Choose **Manage 3D settings** from the left sidebar.
3. Choose the **High-performance NVIDIA processor** option from the Preferred graphics process drop-down menu.  
![High-performance NVIDIA processor option in NVIDIA control panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/high-performance-nvidia-processor-option.jpg)
4. Click the drop-down icon next to **Power management mode** and choose **Prefer maximum performance**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![Prefer maximum performance option in NVIDIA Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/prefer-maximum-performance-option.jpg)
5. Click **Apply.**

 Next, restart your computer and check for the issue.

## 4\. Adjust the Resolution and Scaling Settings

 Windows allows you to manually configure your display resolution and scaling settings. But sometimes configuring these settings to more than the recommended value can cause high GPU usage.

 So, configure your display's scale and resolution to the recommended value. Follow the below instructions to do that:

1. Open Settings, choose **System** from the left sidebar, and **Display** from the right pane.
2. Click the drop-down icon next to **Scale** and choose the recommended value.
3. Choose the recommended value from the **Display resolution** drop-down menu.  
![Scale settings in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scale-settings.jpg)

 After that, open the Task Manager and check the Desktop Window Manager GPU consumption.

## 5\. Disable HDR

 HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a technology that uses your system's GPU to display a wider range of brightness and colors. However, enabling HDR on a weak GPU can do more harm than good.

 If you're experiencing compatibility issues or if apps and processes consume more GPU resources than you'd like, you should disable the HDR feature.

 To disable HDR in Windows 11, open Settings, select System from the left sidebar, and then select Display from the right pane. Then, disable the toggle switch next to **Use HDR**.

![Use HDR option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/use-hdr.jpg)

 After that, your display will momentarily go blank. Subsequently, you'll observe a shift in display color, indicating that you've successfully disabled HDR.

## 6\. Optimize Your Visual Effect Settings

 As aforementioned, the Desktop Window Manager oversees the visual aspects of your computer's interface. But, if your computer's visual effects settings are not correctly configured, the Desktop Window Manager might consume a significant amount of GPU resources.

 To resolve this, you must optimize your computer's visual effects settings. Here's how you can do it:

1. Press the **Win + R** hotkey to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **sysdm.cpl ,3** into the search bar and press **Enter**.  
![Advanced system settings code in the Run dialog box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/advanced-system-settings-code.jpg)
3. Under the Performance section, click on **Settings**.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130889/7443" target="_top" id="2130889">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/>

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130889/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Select the **Adjust for best performance** option.  
![Adjust for best performance option in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/adjust-for-best-performance-option.jpg)
5. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.

 Now, monitor your computer's GPU consumption. If it remains high, there's a possibility that corruption in important system files is causing the issue.

## 7\. Run an SFC Scan

 Itâ€™s common for Windows files to become corrupted due to malware attacks or sudden system crashes. Unfortunately, corruption in these system files not only results in data loss but also disrupts the regular functioning of your computer.

 While recovering the lost data might prove challenging, repairing the corrupt files to resolve ongoing system issues is relatively easy.

 SFC, or System File Checker, is a Windows built-in utility that looks for and repairs current system files. To run an SFC scan, open Command Prompt as an administrator (see how to [launch Command Prompt with administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/)), type **sfc /scannow**, and press **Enter**.

![Sfc scan in Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sfc-scan.jpg)

 After the scan is complete, restart your computer, and you will see that youâ€™re no longer facing the Desktop Window Manager high GPU consumption issue.

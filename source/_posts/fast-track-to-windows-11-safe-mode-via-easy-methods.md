## Fast Track to Windows 11 Safe Mode via Easy Methods

### Key Takeaways

* Boot into safe mode using System Configuration for easy setup and boot customization.
* Access safe mode via the Settings app for a straightforward method to reboot in safe mode.
* To boot into safe mode from the lock screen, restart your PC and navigate through the Windows Recovery Environment.

 In safe mode, Windows starts with a basic set of drivers and files essential to run the system. Everything else, including start-up apps, networking, and Command Prompt, is disabled in safe mode. This helps you determine if an external hardware driver or program conflict is causing your system to malfunction.

 There are different types of safe modes and many ways to access them. If you need to diagnose your PC, here is how to boot into safe mode in Windows 11 on a working or non-booting computer.

## The Different Types of Safe Mode and When to Use Them

 There are three types of safe mode options available in advanced boot options:

* **Safe Mode:** Windows starts with a minimal set of drivers and files and disables everything else.
* **Safe Mode with Networking:** Windows starts with a basic set of drivers in addition to the network drivers necessary to connect to a network or the Internet. Wi-Fi connectivity is not available in this mode.
* **Safe Mode with Command Prompt:** For advanced users who want to access the Command Prompt in safe mode and don’t need the Windows graphical interface.

 To boot into safe mode using the System Configuration utility:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**, type **msconfig** and click **OK**. Alternatively, click **Start**, type **System Configuration** and open the best matching result.
2. In the **System Configuration** window, open the **Boot** tab.

3. Under **Boot options**, select **Safe boot**. By default, the default mode is set to **Minimal**. Depending on your requirements, you can switch between **Alternate Shell (Command Prompt)**, **Network** or **Active Directory repair** options.

![Booting into safe mode from the lock screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/boot-into-safe-mode-from-lock-screen.png)

 If you have [forgotten your Windows password](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-ways-to-reset-the-forgotten-windows-administrator-password/) or can't log in, you can boot into safe mode from the lock screen itself. Here’s how to do it:

1. Restart your PC.

3. Click the **Power/Shutdown** button. Then, press and hold the **Shift** key and click **Restart**. If prompted for confirmation, click **Restart anyway**.
4. Your computer will restart and show the Windows Recovery Environment. From here, go to **Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Start-up settings > Restart.**
5. Press **4** to restart and boot into safe mode.

 Alternatively, you also do this from the desktop**. Click Start > Power** and while holding the **Shift** key, click **Restart**.

## 4\. Boot Into Safe Mode Using Command Prompt and WinRE

## 5\. Boot Into Safe Mode When Windows is Not Booting

 If [Windows is not booting](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-wont-boot/), or you can't see the login screen, you can still access safe mode using the advanced boot option by triggering the Windows Recovery Environment.

 While you can press the F8 key repeatedly during the boot process to access advanced boot options, it doesn't always work. Instead, you can force [Windows to boot into the Windows Recovery Environment](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-boot-into-the-windows-recovery-environment/) by deliberately force shutting down your computer a few times during startup.

 After two consecutive failed attempts, Windows will automatically start WinRE and give access to advanced boot options. To do this:

1. Shut down your computer.
2. Press the **Power** button to power on your PC.
3. When it starts loading, press and hold the Power button to force a shutdown. Repeat the steps to abruptly shut down your computer again.
4. At the third attempt, press the power button and let Windows load and boot into Windows Recovery Environment.
5. Under **Choose an option,** click **Troubleshoot**.
6. Then go to **Advanced options > Start-up settings > Restart.**
7. After the restart, press **4,5 or 6** to boot into safe mode with different options.

2. Type **msconfig** and click **OK** to open the **System Configuration.**
3. In the **Boot** tab, uncheck the **Safe boot** option.

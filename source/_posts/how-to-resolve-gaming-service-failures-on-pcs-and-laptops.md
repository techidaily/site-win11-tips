## How To Resolve Gaming Service Failures on PCs and Laptops

 The Xbox Game Pass is a popular Microsoft subscription service for games. However, some users encounter a 0x800700e9 error when they try to download and install Xbox Game Pass titles via the Xbox app or Microsoft Store. The 0x800700e9 error code message says “Something unexpected happened,” which provides no clue as to how to resolve that issue.

 Users can’t download and install Xbox Game Pass content because of error 0x800700e9\. However, you can fix error 0x800700e9 with these potential resolutions.

## 1\. Run the Microsoft Store App Troubleshooter

 The Windows Store App troubleshooter might help fix the error 0x800700e9\. This is how you can access the Windows Store App troubleshooter in Windows 11:

1. Use one of the many [ways to launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Click the**Troubleshoot** box that has a spanner icon.
3. Next, click**Other-troubleshooters** to access the Settings app’s list of troubleshooting tools.
4. Select**Run** for activating the Windows Store Apps.

5. Apply any suggestions the troubleshooter provides.

 The Windows 10 troubleshooters are available within the**Update & Security** category of Settings. Click the**Troubleshoot** tab in that category and select**Additional troubleshooters** . Then you can select Windows Store Apps from there and click**Run** to access the tool.

## 2\. Turn Delivery Optimization On in Settings

 Delivery Optimization is a service that enables Windows Update downloads from other PCs. Error 0x800700e9 often arises when Delivery Optimization is disabled in Windows. You can turn on Delivery Optimization via Settings like this:

1. Open the**Windows Update** tab in Settings.
2. Click**Advanced options** to view more settings.
3. Select the**Delivery Optimization** navigation option.

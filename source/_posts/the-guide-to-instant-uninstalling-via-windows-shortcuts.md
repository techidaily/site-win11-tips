## The Guide to Instant Uninstalling via Windows Shortcuts

 A desktop context menu option for uninstalling software is a handy addition to Windows 11/10\. With this shortcut, you could uninstall apps directly from the desktop just by right-clicking them. Although the Start menu includes a right-click**Uninstall** option for apps, it isn't available on the desktop's context menu.

 So, how do you add a shortcut for uninstalling software to the Windows 11/10 context menu? We'll outline the steps below to make removing apps easier and quicker.

## How to Add an Uninstall Context Menu Option With IObit Uninstaller

 IObit Uninstaller is one of the [best uninstallers for removing Windows apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstallers-stubborn-apps/) that incorporates numerous features. Among them is an optional**Powerful Uninstall** shortcut you can enable on the Windows 11/10 context menu. That option lets you remove software packages with IObit Uninstaller by right-clicking their desktop shortcuts or EXE files.

 This is how you can add a**Powerful Uninstall** option to the context menu with IObit Uninstaller:

1. Open the [IObit Uninstaller](http://www.iobit.com/en/advanceduninstaller.php) page.
2. Click the**Free Download** button on the IObit page.
3. [Open Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and find the folder where you downloaded the iobituninstaller.exe file.
4. Double-click the**iobituninstaller.exe** file to bring up the setup wizard.
5. Press the green**Install** button.

1. Select**No, thanks** to opt-out of an optional installation if you don't want it.
2. Click**Next** to proceed with the installation.
3. Select**No, thanks** if you don't want to subscribe.
4. Then select**Finish** with the**Run IObit Uninstaller Now** option enabled.
5. The**Powerful Uninstall** context menu option should be enabled by default, but you can double-check by clicking**Options** \>**Settings** in IObit Uninstaller. Select the**Add Powerful Uninstall** **option to Windows context menu** setting on the**Uninstall** tab if necessary, and click the**OK** button.

 Now go ahead and try out the**Powerful Uninstall** context menu option. Right-click a software shortcut on your desktop (preferably for a program you want to remove) and select**Show more options** (in Windows 11). Click the new**Powerful Uninstall** option on the context menu. An IObit Uninstaller window will then open, on which you can select**Uninstall** to remove the program.

 You'll notice that the IOBit Uninstaller window in which the**Powerful Uninstall** option opens also includes an**Automatically remove residual files** setting. Selecting that checkbox will enable a more thorough removal of the program by deleting any leftover residual files and registry keys it leaves behind. That's an option worth selecting before clicking**Uninstall** to [erase junk files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-remove-junk-files/) .

## How to Allow or Block a Biometrics Log-On Using the Registry Editor

 Another way to configure biometrics log-on for the domain users is through the Registry Editor. Here's how:

 Editing the registry is risky, as one wrong edit can make your system unstable. Therefore, make sure to [back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with the steps.

1. Open the Run tool, type **regedit** in the search bar, and press Enter.
2. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Biometrics\Credential Provider`
3. Right-click the **Credential Provider** key in the left sidebar, hover the cursor to **New,** and choose **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.

## 1\. Run the Troubleshooter for Windows Store Apps

 First, start with potential error 0x00000000 resolutions that are more straightforward to apply, such as running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter. Microsoft Store is itself a UWP app for which the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter can fix issues. So, try running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooting tool like this:

1. Press **Start** to select a **Settings** cog button or pinned shortcut on the Windows 11/10 menu.
2. Click Settings’ **System** tab and the **Troubleshoot** navigation option.
3. Select **Other trouble-shooters** to reach the troubleshooting tools in Settings.
4. Click the **Run** option for starting the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.  
![The Run Windows Store Apps option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-run-button.jpg)
5. Then select to apply any potential solution presented within Windows Store Apps.

 In Windows 10, the steps for opening Windows Store Apps aren’t quite the same. Click the **Update & Security** category in Windows 10’s Settings app and select the **Troubleshoot** tab. Then you can click an **Additional troubleshooter** navigation option to reach the list of troubleshooting utilities.

## 2\. Enable the Microsoft Store Install Service

 The Microsoft Store Install Service has a description that says app installations can’t function properly when it’s disabled. So, that’s a necessary service to have enabled to utilize the Microsoft Store without issues. This is how you can check and enable the Microsoft Store Install Service.

1. Click **Start** by pressing the right mouse button and select **Search**.
2. Type a **Services** search phrase into the text box.
3. Next, launch Services by selecting the search result for that app.
4. Double-click **Microsoft Store Install Service** to access its settings.  
![The Services window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-services-window-1.jpg)
5. Open the **Startup type** menu by clicking on it and selecting **Automatic**.  

![Settings for the Microsoft Store Install Service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/microsoft-install-service-properties-window.jpg)
6. Then select **Start** in the Microsoft Store Install Service Properties window.

7. Select **Apply** to save the selected settings for the service.
8. Click the Microsoft Store Install Service window’s **OK** button.

## 3\. Clear the Microsoft Store Cache

 Some Microsoft Store users have confirmed they fixed error 0x00000000 by resetting that app’s cache. So, try clearing Microsoft Store’s cached data.

 Press **Win + R**, type in "cmd," press **Enter**, and enter the command for resetting the Microsoft Store’s cache:

`WSReset.exe`

## 4\. Try Some General Windows Troubleshooting Tips

 There are a few Windows-based fixes you can try that fix general Windows Store issues. So, give these a try:

### Run the System File Checker Command

 Error 0x00000000 can occur because of a wider PC issue with corrupted system files. You can address such a potential cause by running the System File Checker utility. Our [post about running the SFC tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) tells you how to apply this potential solution within the Command Prompt.

![The SFC command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sfc-scannow-command.jpg)

 It’s also recommended to run a Deployment Image Servicing Management scan along with the SFC tool. That utility services and repairs the system image. You can run the Deployment Image Servicing Management tool by executing this command:

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`

### Disable Any Active Proxy Servers

 A proxy server is an intermediary, or middleman, for handling PC client resource requests. Enabling a proxy server might be good for bypassing geographical website restrictions, but it’s a common cause of Microsoft Store errors such as 0x00000000\. So, we recommend that you [disable proxy server settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-proxy/) on your Windows 11/10 PC if they’re enabled to resolve error 0x00000000\.

![The Use a proxy server option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-use-a-proxy-server-option.jpg)

### Reinstall the Microsoft Store

![An uninstall Microsoft Store command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/remove-apppackage-command.jpg)

 Reinstalling Microsoft Store is a slightly more drastic potential fix for error 0x00000000 to apply when others fail. This potential resolution will replace the Microsoft Store’s files.

 However, you cannot simply uninstall the Microsoft Store in Settings and download the app from a web source. Instead, you’ll need to remove that app and reinstall it again by inputting PowerShell commands. Our article about [how to reinstall Microsoft Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/remove-reinstall-microsoft-store-windows-11/) includes step-by-step instructions for applying this potential error 0x00000000 solution.

### Set Up a New Windows User Account

![The Add account button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/add-account-option.jpg)

 You might need to fix error 0x00000000 because of a corrupted user account. Setting up a fresh new user account would then be a probable fix. Note that you can create a new user account and transfer the data from the old one to it.

 Our guide on [creating a new Windows user account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-issues-creating-new-user-account/) explains how to apply such a potential resolution.

### Perform a Windows System Restore

 System Restore is a utility that saves Windows system snapshots. Those system snapshots, otherwise restore points, enable you to roll back Windows to the dates saved. Thus, System Restore is kind of like a time machine with which you can undo system changes applied after selected restore point dates.

 Performing a system restore might repair system file corruption causing the 0x00000000 error. However, it’s only a viable solution if you can select a restore point predating error 0x00000000 on your PC. Note that rolling Windows back also removes apps, drivers, and updates installed after restoration point dates.

 Check out this guide to [setting up and utilizing Windows System Restore points](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) for instructions about how to perform a system restore.

### Do an In-Place Windows Upgrade

 An in-place upgrade effectively installs a new copy of Windows. That may sound like a drastic solution but applying it won’t affect user files or third-party software installed on your PC. Furthermore, upgrading Windows in such a way will probably fix any system issues causing error 0x00000000\.

 Performing an in-place upgrade involves downloading the latest Windows 11 ISO file from Microsoft’s website. Then you can install the latest Windows version by clicking setup.exe within the Windows ISO file and going through the setup wizard. This guide tells you how to [perform an in-place Windows 11 upgrade](https://www.makeuseof.com/in-place-upgrade-windows-11/) in such a way.

 To apply the same potential solution in Windows 10, click **Download tool now** on the [Microsoft Windows 10 download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10).

 Open the downloaded Windows 10 Setup wizard and select the **Upgrade this PC Now** option. Then click the **Keep personal files and apps** option and select **Install**.

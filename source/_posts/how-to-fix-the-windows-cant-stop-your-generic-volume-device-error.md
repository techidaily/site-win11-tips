## How to Fix the “Windows Can’t Stop Your Generic Volume Device” Error

 It’s advisable to safely eject a USB drive inserted in your Windows 11/10 PC. However, upon doing so, some users report seeing an error message that reads “Windows can’t stop your generic volume device.” Consequently, users can’t safely eject USB drives with their PCs on.

 Of course, you can still safely remove a USB drive with a PC off. However, many users still prefer to be able to safely eject their connected drives without shutting down their computer. This is how you can fix the “Windows can’t stop your generic volume device” error.

## 1\. Disable Background App Processes

 Disabling background app processes is the first thing you should try when you see the “Windows can’t stop your generic volume device” error. Even the error message suggests closing programs that could still be using the device.

 Make sure there aren’t any minimized software windows on your taskbar; close unneeded apps within the system tray area by right-clicking their icons and selecting exit options.

 Beyond the taskbar and system tray, you’ll need to look for and disable background app processes with Task Manager. Task Manager is a tool that provides a comprehensive overview of app and service background processes.

 Our guide on [fixing too many background processes running](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-pc-too-many-background-processes/) provides more detail on how to terminate unneeded background apps and services with Task Manager.

 You will need to replace **<drive number>** for the select disk command with the actual number of your USB drive listed by Diskpart. For example, if your USB drive is disk 1, the required command would look like this:

`select disk 1`

 Setting a drive offline changes its status to missing. You can set the same drive back to an online status by repeating steps one to five above and then executing this command:

`online disk`

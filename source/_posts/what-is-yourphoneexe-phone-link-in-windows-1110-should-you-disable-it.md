![PowerShell Console with Command to Uninstall Phone Link App in Windows 10](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/uninstall-phone-link-app-using-powershell-windows.jpg)

 If you don’t use the Phone Link app or if the yourphone.exe process continues to appear even after disabling background app permissions, you can uninstall the app completely from your Windows computer.

 To uninstall the Phone Link app:

1. Press the **Win** key and type **PowerShell**.
2. Next, right-click on **PowerShell** from the search results and select **Run as administrator**.
3. In the PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.YourPhone -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage`
4. Once the command is executed, it’ll remove the Phone Link app from your computer.

 You can re-install the Phone Link app from the Microsoft Store if you want to give the app another shot.

## Is YourPhone.exe a Virus or Trojan?

 Yourphone.exe or Phone Link is not a malicious process or virus but part of the Phone Link app on Windows. Don’t be alarmed if you notice the process in Task Manager. If you need to remove it, you can do so by limiting the background permission for the app or by uninstalling it from your computer.

## Managing the Phone Link Process in Windows 10 and 11

 The Phone Link (yourphone.exe) process is not a security risk; allowing it to run in the background is necessary for the app to render its services. Limiting its background permission may prevent it from connecting to your phone and showing up-to-date information. That said, if you don’t have a use for the app, you can delete it using PowerShell and save some storage space on your hard drive.

 Microsoft Phone Link (formerly Your Phone) is a Windows app that connects your Android phone or iPhone to your computer. As the app runs in the background, you may notice the yourphone.exe process appear in Task Manager.

 Phone Link is a legitimate utility and has minimal effect on your system's performance. However, if you find it resource-intensive, you can safely disable it from running in the background. This guide explains the details of the yourphone.exe process and how to safely disable and remove the app in Windows 10 and 11\.

## What Is the YourPhone.exe (PhoneExperienceHost.exe) Process?

 The Phone Link (YourPhone.exe) is a legitimate process related to the Phone Link (formerly Your Phone) app. It is a handy utility that lets you [connect your iPhone and Android device to your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-phone-link-guide/), receive notifications, make calls, record screens, etc.

 Even when you are not actively using it, the process runs in the background with minimal effect on system performance. It also needs to connect to your network to work with your phone and sync notifications.

 However, if the Phone Link process is causing system performance issues, you can safely terminate the process from Task Manager. If you still see Your Phone instead of Phone Link, open the Microsoft Store and update the app to the latest version.

## How to End the Your Phone.exe Process Using Task Manager
![Phone Link Process End Task in Windows 10 Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/phone-link-process-end-task-windows-10.jpg)

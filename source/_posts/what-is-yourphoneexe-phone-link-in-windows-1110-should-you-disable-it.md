2. Next, right-click on **PowerShell** from the search results and select **Run as administrator**.

`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.YourPhone -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage`

## Managing the Phone Link Process in Windows 10 and 11

 The Phone Link (yourphone.exe) process is not a security risk; allowing it to run in the background is necessary for the app to render its services.

That said, if you don’t have a use for the app, you can delete it using PowerShell and save some storage space on your hard drive.

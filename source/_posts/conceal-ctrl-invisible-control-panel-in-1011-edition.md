However, in the case of hiding your Power button, the quickest way is also the easiest.

### 1\. Hide the Power Button on the Start Menu with the Windows Registry

2. Type in 'regedit' and hit **Enter**.
3. In the Registry Editor, head to the following location:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Start\HidePowerButton
4. Right-click on the **Value** key from the right and change its value to **1**.

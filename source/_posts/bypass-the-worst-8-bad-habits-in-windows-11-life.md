## Bypass the Worst: 8 Bad Habits in Windows 11 Life

 Windows 11 is known for its customizability, allowing users to make changes in lots of areas of the OS. However, while we all love the ability to customize our OS and have control over settings, sometimes it's better to live with the default setup. In the case of Windows 11, you will be better off not touching certain things in the OS.

 We've put together a list of things you should never do in Windows 11\. Not only that, but we're also giving reasons why you should not change them on your PC.

## 1\. Microsoft Defender Protects Your PC From Threats, Never Disable It

 Microsoft Defender, formerly known as Windows Defender, is your default antivirus app that protects your PCs from various threats, including viruses, malware, spyware, and phishing. It protects you from falling prey to threats emanating from both online and offline.

 The Microsoft Defender SmartScreen feature checks websites for potential phishing and malware and prevents your PCs from getting infected. Features such as Parental controls and Firewall are some of the other noteworthy features of the Microsoft Defender app. And all of these are free to use in the app for Windows 10 and 11 users.

 While Microsoft Defender is not as good as paid antivirus software, it checks all the boxes to provide you with decent protection. Unless you plan on installing paid antivirus software, you should never turn off the Microsoft Defender application.

 However, if you're confused about whether you should purchase antivirus software, [check out if Microsoft Defender is good enough for you](https://www.makeuseof.com/is-microsoft-defender-the-best-antivirus-for-your-pc-in-2021/).

## 2\. You Should Not Download Software From Untrusted Sources

![The Microsoft Store app](https://thmb.techidaily.com/2ce1793b7eb9df5d73bd2287ee2fb75c54bfd7ec38a9d51d9c25c70c5f788347.jpg)

 No matter how advanced antivirus software you use on your PC, never download software from untrusted sources. And if you're not much of an internet person, it can be tricky to identify trustworthy sources.

 However, as a rule of thumb, always remember this: search the internet to know people's feedback about that particular software and, of course, the website before installing anything.

 If you're not good at searching the internet, try using Microsoft Store to download your apps. Apps available on the Microsoft Store are checked by Microsoft and considered safe. Notably, downloading anything from Microsoft Store will require a Microsoft account.

## 3\. Windows Updates Are Important, Never Miss Them

![Checking for Available Windows Updates in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Image-1-Checking-for-Available-Windows-Updates-in-Windows-Settings-App.jpg)

 After releasing a major Windows update, Microsoft continues to push security updates to keep your PC safe from the latest malware. Avoiding or delaying installing those monthly security updates will put your PC at severe risk.

 Besides security updates, the company also pushes quality updates and small feature updates, giving you access to the latest new features and improvements.

 Granted, Windows updates can cause annoyance sometimes and impact your workflow. But most of the time, only a small set of users with specific pieces of hardware are affected. And even if you're part of that small set of users, Microsoft is quick enough to issue a fix via a software update. In short, the rewards are bigger than the risks.

## 4\. You Should Not Choose Weak Passwords

![Password and lock symbol on white background](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/remove-passwords-browser.jpg)

 While being able to log in to our online accounts and services without having to type a password sounds like a great idea, we're not quite there yet. We use passwords everywhere to keep our online and offline accounts safe.

 If you're using Windows 11, or any other OS for that matter, remember to choose a strong password. A strong password has the following characteristics:

* It's a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols and is 12 or 14 characters long.
* It should be different from your previous passwords.
* It should be easy to remember for you.

 If you're not a pro at generating a strong password by yourself, check our list of the [best password generators for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/desktop-password-generators-windows/).

## 5\. Never Use Public Wi-Fi Without VPN

![connecting to a virtual private network on laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/laptop-screen-showing-a-vpn-connection.jpg)

 Public Wi-Fi services can come to your rescue if you've run out of mobile data and don't have broadband at home. It's essentially free internet offered by businesses, organizations, or municipalities in public places, helping you save money.

 Before the benefits lure you into logging into public WiFi, just be aware of the risk involved. However, you can mitigate the risks by using a VPN service.

 A VPN service will not expose your true identity to hackers, thus helping you stay protected and protect your privacy. We have a guide to help you choose between the [fastest VPN services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-great-free-vpn-services-compared-which-is-fastest/).

## 6\. Outdated Software Can Give You Trouble, Try to Avoid Them

 An outdated piece of software may put your PC at risk, not just in Windows 11 but in other OSes as well. It's easier for a hacker to infect an old piece of software with malware than a new one.

 There are multiple reasons why hackers target old software. For one, app developers may no longer issue security patches because the software is too old. Therefore, old pieces of software don't protect against the ever-changing and always-evolving malware threat.

 Besides security, outdated software will always lag in other key metrics, including performance and functionality. A newer software version will provide the latest features and optimum protection. Software in Windows 11 PCs is not an exception.

## 7\. You Shouldn't Disable User Account Control, Unless You're an Advanced User

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![The User Account Control Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-uac-settings.jpg)

 User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows 11\. It's enabled by default to keep your PC safe from risks that could be triggered when you make specific changes to your PC.

 When enabled, UAC will display a warning message asking you to allow or deny those changes on your PC. It may also ask for an administrator password before letting you make unauthorized changes.

 Unless you're an advanced user wanting to bypass those prompts, you should never [disable the UAC prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-user-account-control-prompt/). When UAC is turned off, you won't get any prompts to warn you about the consequences of the change. So, if you're a casual user, you better avoid changing the UAC's default state.

## 8\. Avoid Installing Too Many Programs on Your PC

 When you're no longer using a program, it's always better to get rid of it. We recommend you uninstall all the programs that are no longer essential to you. By uninstalling them, you can free the system's memory and improve the overall performance of your PCs.

 Moreover, you should always keep an eye on the number of apps running in the background. And if too many of them are in the background, the app currently in use may not be as responsive as you'd want it to be. Installing too many apps on your PC makes your system more cluttered and makes it difficult to find them.

## Now You're Aware of What You Shouldn't Do in Windows 11

 All the features you find in Windows 11 are meant to achieve something, but they're not for everyone. Just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean the OS encourages you to do that.

 On the flip side, Windows 11's default setup doesn't always work in your best interest. This is why it's important to know what you should change and what you should not.

 We've put together a list of things you should never do in Windows 11\. Not only that, but we're also giving reasons why you should not change them on your PC.

 Windows has a built-in audio troubleshooter to find and fix issues with playing audio. The troubleshooter looks for common audio issues and tries to fix them automatically.

To run the audio troubleshooter:

2. In the**System** tab, click on**Troubleshoot** .

5. Follow the on-screen instructions and check if the error is resolved.

## 2\. Disable Exclusive Mode for the Audio Device

 By default, Windows applications can take exclusive control of the audio device. While enabling this option shouldn’t cause any issues, some apps may prevent the device from being used by other audio services. To fix the problem, disable exclusive mode to stop applications from taking exclusive control of the audio device.

## 5\. Uninstall and Reinstall the Audio Device and Driver

![Uninstalling an audio device in Windows 11.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uninstalling-audio-device-windows-11.jpg)

 You can also troubleshoot your audio problems by uninstalling the audio device and the associated drivers. Reinstalling the audio device can help if the sound problem is due to corrupt audio drivers.

To uninstall your audio device on Windows:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX menu** .
2. Select**Device Manager** for the menu.
3. In Device Manager, expand the**Audio inputs and output section** .
4. Right-click on your audio device and select**Uninstall device** .
5. Read the warning and click**Uninstall** to confirm the action. Wait for the device to uninstall.

 You may see a yellow exclamation mark on the uninstalled audio device. To reinstall the driver, click on**File** and select**Scan for hardware changes** . This should reinstall the sound device and driver. If not, restart your computer. As the system restarts, Windows will reinstall the missing audio device driver and restore sound on your computer.

## 6\. Perform a Driver Rollback

 If you have an external sound card and have installed an update, try a driver rollback. A new driver update can sometimes create more problems than it intends to fix. You can use the device driver rollback feature in Device Manager to undo the changes and reinstall the older version of the driver.

 You can[roll back a driver using Windows Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/) . In Device Manager, expand the**Sound, Video, and Game Controllers** section. Next, access your external sound card properties to perform a rollback.

 If the Roll Back Driver option is greyed out, it means the option is unavailable for the selected device. In this instance, uninstall the existing audio device driver and download an older version of the driver from your sound card manufacturer's website. Your sound card manufacturer may also have a newer driver version available. If available, install the latest version and check for any improvements.

## 7\. Install Pending Windows Updates

![windows 11 view update history](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/winodws-11-view-update-history.jpg)

 If it is a Windows-specific issue, installing pending Windows updates can fix the problem. Check the Windows updates page for newer updates and install them to see if that helps resolve the issue.

 To install Windows update, go to**Settings > Windows Update** and click**Check for updates** . Windows will populate the screen with all the pending updates. You can install the updates or selectively install any audio device updates.

## 8\. Check for Third-Party App Conflict

![volume mixer windows 11 view audio applications](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/volume-mixer-windows-11-view-audio-applications.jpg)

 If the issue persists, check if there is a third-party app conflict. You can use Volume Mixer to view applications accessing the audio devices and close the problematic app to fix the problem. Here’s how to do it.

1. Press**Win + R** to open Run.
2. Type**sndvol** and click**OK** to open Volume Mixer.
3. The**Application** column will show all the apps using your audio device.

 To close the app, open the system tray, right-click the app icon, and select**Quit** . You can also force close the app using Task Manager. If the issue persists, uninstall the problematic app to restore the audio to your computer.

## Fixing the Audio Device in Use By Another Application Error

 This error is often the result of an audio device driver problem. To fix the error, check if a new driver is available. If not, perform a rollback to install the previous driver version. Also, disable exclusive application access to audio devices and configure the Windows Audio service to start automatically.

To run an SFC scan, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run Command.

sfc /scannow
5. Press Enter to execute the command. This will scan your computer for corrupted system files and replace them with the correct ones if any are found.

 Once the process is complete, restart the computer and open Task Scheduler to check if the issue has been resolved.

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

 This will scan your computer for any corrupted Windows images on your computer and try to fix them. The process may take a while to complete. Once it's done, restart your computer and see if it works.

## 3\. Restart the Task Scheduler Service

 The next thing you can do is restart the Task Scheduler Service and make sure the Startup type is set to Automatic. It will reset the service and can potentially solve any underlying issues quickly. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** from the menu list.
2. In the Run dialog box, type**services.msc** and hit**Enter** .
3. Scroll down the list of services and locate**Task Scheduler** .
4. Right-click on it and select**Restart** from the menu list.

 Once restarted, try to run your scheduled tasks again and see if you can now schedule them properly.

## 4\. Check for Windows Updates

 In some cases, outdated versions of Windows may also cause problems and prevent you from scheduling tasks effectively. If you want to ensure your system is running the latest version of Windows, follow these steps:

1. Click Start and select**Settings** from the pinned items. In case you don't find it, use**Win + I** to open it directly.
2. In the left pane, click**Windows Update** .  
![Check for Updates](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/check-for-updates.jpg)
3. Then click on**Check for updates** to see if there are any updates.

 If updates are available, Windows will automatically download and install them. After installing the updates, restart your computer to see if that fixes the problem.

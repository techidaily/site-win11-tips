## 9\. Utilize Cloud Storage Instead

 You don’t have to transfer images and videos from your iPhone to your PC with a USB cable. Instead, try uploading and downloading files from your iPhone to your PC by utilizing cloud storage services such as iCloud. Check out our guide to [utilizing iCloud in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/icloud-windows-pc-use/) for further details about how you can move files between devices with that cloud storage service.

You can sync files between your PC and mobile with the Google Drive desktop software. Our [Google Drive for desktop guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-drive-for-desktop/) includes full instructions about how to sync files with that software.

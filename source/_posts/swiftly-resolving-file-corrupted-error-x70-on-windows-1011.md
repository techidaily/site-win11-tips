 Error 0x80070570 is a Windows issue that sometimes pops up when you try to delete files on external hard drives. This error also occurs when users try to transfer files between PCs and external drives. The error 0x80070570 message says, “The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.”

 Consequently, you can’t delete or copy files on drives affected by error 0x80070570\. It is an error code that predates Windows 8, but many users still encounter this issue on the latest Windows desktop platforms. As such, here is how you can fix error 0x80070570 on Windows 10 and 11\.

## 1\. Repair System Files With an SFC Scan

 Some users have confirmed repairing system files resolved error 0x80070570 on their PCs. System File Checker is a command-line tool with which you can check for and repair corrupted system files that might be causing file operation issues.

## 2\. Utilize the Check Disk Tool

 Drive file system issues often cause error 0x80070570\. The most widely confirmed solution for that error is to run a CHKDSK scan of the drive you can’t delete files on or transfer files to. The CHKDSK tool can repair file system errors on the drive it’s scanning.

![The chkdsk scan command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chkdsk-scan-command.jpg)

 Our [guide to running CHKDSK on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-mini-how-to-run-chkdsk-in-windows-10/#:~:text=In%20Command%20Prompt%2C%20type%20chkdsk,let%20it%20do%20its%20work.) tells you how to initiate a Check Disk scan. You’ll need to run the Check Disk scan for the drive that includes the files you can’t delete or copy to. If that’s an external drive, you’ll need to connect the storage device to the PC and specify its letter within the command. For example, a CHKDSK command for scanning an external E: drive would be:

`chkdsk /r E:`

## 3\. Try Moving Files to a Different Location

 If error 0x80070570 when you’re trying to transfer a file, try moving (or copying) the file into a different folder location on the target drive. You can do that by right-clicking an affected file and selecting either **Cut** or **Copy**. Then right-click inside a different folder location and select **Paste** to see if the error occurs.

## 4\. Turn Off Real-Time Antivirus Shields

 Another possible factor for error 0x80070570 occurring is your PC’s antivirus shield is hindering the file operation. That could happen if your antivirus software wrongly flags files you’re trying to transfer between drives as suspicious. So, try temporarily disabling your antivirus shield before performing the required file operation.

![The Real-time protection option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/real-time-protection-option.jpg)

 If you don’t have third-party security software, turn off Windows Security’s real-time antivirus shield, as covered in our article about [disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/permanently-disable-microsoft-defender-windows-11/). .

 Users with third-party antivirus utilities will need to turn off their antivirus shields via the apps’ system tray context menus. Right-click the antivirus app’s icon in the system tray and select a disable or turn off shield protection setting.

5. Select **Continue** to initiate the repair.

## 6\. Format an External Drive

## Fixing WinSplit Display Issues Now

 Split screen is convenient for multitasking on Windows computers. You use this feature to compare and copy data between two or more programs or windows simultaneously. But what if this feature stops working? This article discusses how to fix split screen problems on Windows.

## What Causes Split Screen to Not Work?

 Before you troubleshoot, you must understand why the split screen isn't working. Some of the most common reasons include.

1. **The feature isn’t enabled in the system settings:** It’s possible that you accidentally disabled the split screen feature in your system settings.
2. **Your graphics drivers aren’t updated:** Outdated graphics drivers can lead to split screen problems.
3. **An outdated version of Windows:** If you’re using an older version of Windows, the split screen feature may not work properly.
4. **The display settings are changed:** If the resolution or other display settings are changed, it can cause split screen issues.
5. **The feature isn’t supported in the application:** It's also possible that the application you're trying to use doesn't support a split screen.

 Now that you know the potential causes of the split screen not working, let’s look at how to resolve it.

## 1\. Try Some Generic Fixes

 Before we jump into more complicated fixes, it's worth trying out some basic ones that typically fix Windows errors like this.

1. The first step to resolving any computer issue is to [restart your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/). This often solves minor bugs that may cause common problems to occur.
2. There are also some generic solutions you can try that fix Windows-specific errors. These include [System File Checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management. Running these utilities [clears out corrupted or missing system files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) and replaces them with new ones.
3. You can also [perform a Clean Boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) to resolve split screen problems. This method starts Windows with a minimum set of drivers and programs. If this works, it means a driver or program you installed recently is causing the problem; uninstall the culprit and try again.
4. If the split screen still doesn't work, update your graphics driver. Outdated drivers usually cause conflicts and lead to problems such as split screen not working. To do that, check out [how to update your graphics drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/).

1. Right-click on **Start** and select **Settings**.
2. In the Settings window, select **System** \> **Multi**\-**tasking**.
3. On the next page, turn on **Snap windows**.

## 3\. Check Your Display Settings

 If updating the driver doesn't work, review your display settings. Sometimes, split screen issues come about when the display resolution is not set correctly. In this situation, adjust Windows resolution and check if it resolves the problem.

 To get started, [open Windows Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) and navigate to **System** \> **Display**. In the right pane, scroll down to the **Scale & layout** section.

![Display Resolution in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/display-resolution-in-settings.jpg)

 Now click the **Display resolution** drop-down menu and adjust the resolution to fit your connected display. Once you've done that, try using split screen again.

## 4\. Restart Windows Explorer

 If the problem continues, go to Task Manager and restart Windows Explorer. This is a vital process in Windows that handles the visual components of the system.

 To restart Windows Explorer, follow these steps.

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select **Task Manager**. You can also press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the tool directly.
2. In the Task Manager window, go to the **Details** tab.
3. Scroll down and look for **Windows Explorer**.
4. Once you find the process, right-click on it and select **End task**. This will terminate the Windows Explorer process.  
![Restart Windows Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/restart-windows-explorer.jpg)
5. Now click **Run new task** at the top of the Task Manager window.
6. Type **explorer.exe** in the Open field and click **OK**. This will start a new Windows Explorer instance.

 After restarting Windows Explorer, try split screen again and see if it works now.

## 5\. Uninstall Third-Party Software

 If you have any third-party software or applications that manage Windows or screen layouts, uninstall them temporarily. Sometimes these programs interfere with Windows split-screen functionality and cause the issue.

 To remove such applications from your device, use the following instructions:

1. Press **Win + S** on your keyboard to open Windows search.
2. Type **Control Panel** in the search bar and hit Enter.
3. In the Control Panel window, set the View by option to Category.
4. Now click **Programs** \> **Programs and Features** \> **Uninstall a program**.
5. Locate and right-click on the application that interferes with the split screen.
6. Select **Uninstall** from the context menu and follow the instructions to complete the process.

 Once you're done, try to use split screen to check if the issue is resolved.

## 6\. Use the Built-In Shortcut Keys for Split Screen

 Windows has built-in keyboard shortcuts to launch split screens quickly. This method is useful if the issue occurs due to a minor bug or glitch.

 To use split screen, press **Win + Left Arrow** on your keyboard. This makes one window dominate the left side of your screen. The same applies to **Win + Right Arrow**, which makes one window take up the right side of your screen.

 Similarly, press **Win + Up Arrow** or **Down Arrow** to snap windows into a quarter-screen size, allowing you to have four windows open simultaneously.

## Manage Apps and Tasks Simultaneously to Enhance Your Productivity on Windows

 Whether it’s for work or leisure, a split screen can make all the difference in multitasking. Now that you know how to fix split screen problems on Windows, you can manage your apps and tasks simultaneously easily.

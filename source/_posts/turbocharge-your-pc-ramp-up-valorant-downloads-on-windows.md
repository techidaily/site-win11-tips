## Turbocharge Your PC: Ramp Up Valorant Downloads on Windows

 Valorant is a popular first-person hero shooter developed by Riot Games, so there are always new people downloading the game for the first time. However, for many users, the Valorant download gets stuck on an excruciatingly slow download rate of 0.1KB/s.

 If you also encounter the same problem, consider trying the below solutions to resolve the issue for good.

## Why Does Valorant's Download Get Stuck on 0.1KB/s?

 A weak internet connection is one of the primary reasons why Valorant downloading gets stuck on 0.1KB/s. However, it's not the only potential cause. There are many more culprits that can be responsible for the problem:

1. If there's an ongoing issue with the DNS server, it can affect your Valorant download speed.
2. Windows Defender Firewall can block some necessary Riot Client services and cause this slow download problem.
3. The problem can also appear due to outdated or corrupt network drivers.

 Thankfully, you can quickly resolve the problem with a few simple fixes.

## 1\. Restart the Download

 Let's start with the basic but most effective solution—restarting the download. As it turns out, the problem can result from a temporary glitch in the Riot Client. In this situation, just give the download a restart and check if it solves the issue.

## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 The Riot Client will fail to download or update Valorant if you are connected to a weak and unstable internet connection. You can check internet stability and speed by visiting an[internet speed checking website](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) . If you notice that you are getting a comparatively lower speed, try rebooting the router.

 If power cycling the router didn't improve your download speeds, contact your ISP and ask that they resolve the problem.

## 3\. Close All the Discord Services From the Background

 Valorant's download speed may reduce to a crawl if Discord or any of its related services is running in the background. As it turns out, Discord is known for consuming a major part of available bandwidth and adversely affecting other applications' downloads.

 So, close Discord from the background and check if it fixes the issue. Here's how to do it.

1. [Open Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) using the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** hotkey.
2. Right-click on Discord and choose**End Task** from the context menu.  
![End task option to close Discord](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/end-task-option.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Along with Discord, you can also consider closing all other network-consuming applications like Chrome and Spotify from the background.

 Next, launch the Riot Client, start the downloading process, and check if the problem continues.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Switch to Google's DNS Server

 The Riot Client will struggle to initiate the downloading process if your current[DNS server](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dns/) is unstable. You can try switching to a different DNS server to eliminate the problem.

 While there are plenty of public DNS servers you can swap to, Google's servers are one of the most popular choices. As such, our guide will cover connecting to Google's DNS. If you want a different one, be sure to check out the[best DNS servers for improved online safety](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-dns-providers-security/) and replace the IP addresses in the guide below with your chosen server.

1. Open**Settings** using**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Choose**Network & internet** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Wi-Fi** \>**Hardware Properties** .
4. Click on**Edit** next to**DNS server assignment** .  
![Wi-Fi properties screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DNS-server.jpg)
5. Click on the drop-down icon under**Edit DNS settings** , and choose**Manual** from the context menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
6. As per your DNS provider, choose**IPv4** or**IPv6** .
7. If you choose IPv4, enter**8.8.8.8** and**8.8.4.4** in**Preferred** and**Alternate DNS servers** , respectively.
8. If you choose IPv6, enter**2001:4860:4860::8888** and**2001:4860:4860::8844** in**Preferred** and**Alternate DNS servers** , respectively.  
![Edit DNS settings screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IPv6-settings.jpg)
9. Click on Save.

Check if you are still facing the problem.

## 5\. Allow the Riot Client to Communicate Through the Windows Defender Firewall

 The issue can pop up if the Riot Client is blocked under Windows Defender's settings. As such, you can try whitelisting the Riot Client in the firewall settings to get rid of the issue. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the**Start Menu** , type**Firewall and Network protection** , and press Enter.
2. Click on**Allow an app through the firewall** .
3. Checkmark both**Private** and**Public** boxes next to**Riot Client** .  
![Allow app to communicate through the Firewall screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Riot-Client.jpg)
4. Click on OK to save the changes.

 Try to download Valorant and check if the problem continues. If yes, try the next solution on the list.

## 6\. Uninstall Avast Antivirus

 For many users, Valorant started downloading at normal speed after uninstalling the Avast antivirus. So, you can try this on your computer as well and check if it makes any difference. Here's how to uninstall Avast on your computer:

1. Open Windows Search, type**Control Panel** in the search bar and press Enter.
2. Choose**Uninstall a program** .
3. Right-click on Avast and choose**Uninstall** from the context menu.

 After that, follow the on-screen instruction to complete the uninstallation process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Flush the DNS Cache

 The DNS cache stores data of all your computer's DNS queries for future use. However, if the DNS cache gets corrupt for some reason, it can cause connection issues.

 As a solution, you will have to clear the DNS cache data. Clearing the DNS cache will flush all the IP addresses and the DNS records. Here's how to flush the DNS cache on Windows 11.

1. Open**Command Prompt** .
2. Type**ipconfig /flushdns** and press Enter.  
![The flush DNS command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/flushdns-command.jpg)

 Wait until you see the message "Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache." After that, reboot the system and check for the problem.

## 8\. Update Your Network Drivers

 An outdated or corrupt network driver can also cause connection issues. When you experience a network-related issue, updating your network driver sometimes fixes the problem.

Here are the steps for downloading the latest network drivers:

1. Open Device Manager using one of the[many ways to open the Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) .
2. Double-click on**Network adapters** .
3. Right-click on the installed network driver, and choose the**Update driver** option.  
![The network adapters section in Windows Device Manager.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/update-network-drivers-win-11.jpg)
4. Click on**Search automatically for drivers** .
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Windows will now look for and install the best available network driver for the system. Once the update process is complete, reboot the system and check if the problem is fixed or not.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 9\. Change Riot Client Priority

 The next solution on the list is to change the priority of Riot Client. After changing the priority to high, Windows will give more importance to Riot Client, automatically fixing the problem at hand.

Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Open the Task Manager.
2. Switch to the**Details** tab.
3. Right-click on**RiotClientServices.exe** , hover the cursor to**Set priority** , and choose**High** from the context menu.  
![Task Manager Detail tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Set-Priority-.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Relaunch the client, and you will notice that you are no longer facing the problem.

## 10\. Reset the Network Settings

 Sometimes your current network settings can be the reason behind slow downloading in different applications, including Valorant. To fix this, you'll have to reset the network settings, which will reinstall the network adapters, and configure other network services back to their default values.

Here's how to reset the network settings:

1. Open the Settings menu and navigate to Network & internet > Advanced network settings > Network reset.
2. Click the**Reset now** button next to**Network reset** .  
![Reset now button in the Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/reset-now-button-1.jpg)
3. Click**Yes** to the UAC that crops up.

## Valorant Downloading Issue Fixed

 It's a very straightforward process to download or update Valorant using the Riot Client. But the client can run into issues from time to time as well.

 If the Valorant download or update gets stuck on 0.1KB/s, feel free to use the above solutions. But in the worst-case scenario, if nothing worked, consider connecting with the[Riot Games support team](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) .

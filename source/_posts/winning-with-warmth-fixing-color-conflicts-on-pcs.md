## 3\. Reinstall Your Graphics Driver

 If updating your graphics driver doesn't fix the problem, you might want to try reinstalling your graphics driver. Check out[how to cleanly uninstall and reinstall your GPU drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-cleanly-install-and-reinstall-gpu-drivers-on-windows/) for more on this topic.

 Once you've done that, check if color management is working again.

## 4\. Perform a Factory Reset

 The last resort is to perform a factory reset on Windows. A factory reset is when you delete everything on your computer and start from scratch. This is a good way to fix color management because it gets rid of any corrupt files that might be causing the problem.

 However, before you do a full reset, make sure to back up all of your important files. That way, you won't lose anything if something goes wrong during the process. Once you're done, check out[how to factory reset Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) to start again with a fresh slate.

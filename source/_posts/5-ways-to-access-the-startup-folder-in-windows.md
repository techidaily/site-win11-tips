## 5 Ways to Access the Startup Folder in Windows

 The Startup folder determines which programs automatically launch upon starting your computer. If you're not okay with certain programs launching at startup or want to add a few of your own, you can do it in the Startup folder.

 However, finding the Startup folder isn't that simple. It's buried deep within your system files, which often requires an in-depth search. In this guide, we explore how to quickly find and access the Startup folder on Windows. Let's see how to open the Startup folder.

## 1\. How to Access Startup Folder Using the Run Command

 The Run command gives you quick access to various system functions and saves time navigating system menus. To open the Startup folder using the Run command, follow these steps:

1. [Open the Run command window](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/).
2. Type **Shell:startup** in the search field and click **OK**.

 The Startup folder will open in a new File Explorer window. Here, you can manage all the programs that launch at startup and insert new ones.

## 2\. How to Access Startup Folder Using Task Manager

 Task Manager controls processes and services running on your computer. It also has a "Run new task" option for launching things like files and folders.

 To open the Startup folder using Task Manager, follow these steps:

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager. If the shortcut key fails, right-click on the Taskbar. Then select **Task Manager** from the menu list.
2. In the Task Manager window, click **Run new task** at the top of the screen.

3. Type **Shell:startup** in the dialog box and hit Enter. The Startup folder will now open on your screen.

## 3\. How to Access Startup Folder From File Explorer

 File Explorer gives you quick access to files. It has an address bar that makes finding folders and files super easy. To open the Startup folder from File Explorer, do the following:

1. [Open the Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. In the address bar, type **shell:startup** and hit **Enter**.

## 4\. How to Access Startup Folder Using a Desktop Shortcut

 Creating a desktop shortcut is another way to access the Startup folder. A desktop shortcut offers quick access, and you don't need to search for the folder every time you want to make changes.

 To create a desktop shortcut for the Startup folder, do the following:

1. Press **Win + D** on your keyboard. This minimizes the open windows and takes you to your desktop.
2. Right-click the empty area and choose **New** \> **Shortcut**. The Create Shortcut window will pop up on the screen.

3. In the Location field, type or paste the following.  
`%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
4. Click **Next** and give the shortcut a name you like.
5. Now click **Finish**, and you’ll see the shortcut on your desktop. To open the Startup folder, just double-click it.

## 5\. How to Access Startup Folder Using a Shortcut Key

 To access the Startup folder, you can also create a custom shortcut key. This method is preferred for those who often change the Startup folder. Here’s how to do it:

1. Create a desktop shortcut for the **Startup folder**. We’ve already discussed how to do that above.
2. Right-click the **Shortcut** and select **Properties**. This opens the **Shortcut** tab in the Properties window.
3. Go to the **Shortcut key** field and type any letter inside it.  
![Create Startup Folder Shortcut Key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/create-startup-folder-shortcut-key.jpg)
4. You will see that Windows automatically adds **Ctrl + Alt** to the shortcut.
5. Click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes.

 Now whenever you press **Ctrl + Alt** and the letter associated with the shortcut, your Startup folder will open.

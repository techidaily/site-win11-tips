## Dealing with One-Way Outlook on Secure Windows Operating System

 Opening Outlook in safe mode can help you diagnose and fix a variety of issues with the app. However, it can be confusing if Microsoft Outlook is only accessible in safe mode. Fortunately, there’s no need to settle for a subpar experience, as it is possible to fix this issue.

 In this guide, we've put together a few troubleshooting tips that'll restore the Outlook app to normalcy.

## 1\. Disable Outlook Add-Ins

 Although Outlook add-ins can be useful, they may not always function properly. It’s possible that a conflicting add-in is causing Outlook to open in safe mode repeatedly. To check for this possibility, you can disable all your add-ins and then try to open the Outlook app again.

To disable add-ins in Outlook:

1. In the Outlook app, click the**File** menu at the top.
2. Select**Options** from the left pane.
3. In the Outlook Options window, select**Add-ins** from the left sidebar.
4. Click the**Go** button next to**COM Add-ins** .
5. Clear all the checkboxes to disable your add-ins.
6. Click**OK** to save changes.

![Disable Outlook Add-Ins-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/disable-outlook-add-ins-1.jpg)

 Restart the Outlook app after this and see if it opens in normal mode. If this solves your problem, it means the add-in which was causing the problem got disabled. To identify it, you can re-enable your add-ins one at a time until the problem occurs again. Once you've identified the problematic add-in, you may want to remove it to avoid such issues in the future.

2. Type**outlook.exe /resetnavpane** in the Open field and press**Enter** .

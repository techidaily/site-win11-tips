## Enabling Superuser in Terminal: A Step-by-Step Guide

 Command Prompt is one of the most powerful tools available in the Windows operating system. It provides a command-line interface for running scripts and commands to access hidden features and perform administrative tasks. Unfortunately, there have been reports of trouble running Command Prompt as an administrator.

 If you are experiencing the same problem, don't worry - there's an easy fix. In this blog post, we'll show you how to resolve the problem of Command Prompt not running as an administrator in Windows 11.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If you are having trouble running Command Prompt as an administrator, try restarting your computer first. This simple step can often solve many of your issues since it will reset the faulty settings and clear out any temporary files that may be causing problems.

## 2\. Create a New User Account

 If it prevents you from creating a shortcut for Command Prompt, you may have to create a new user account. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel. Check out[how to open the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) if you get stuck.

## 4\. Check for Any New Windows Updates

 Windows Update is a critical component of keeping your computer up to date. As such, if Command Prompt fails to run as an administrator, check for any new Windows updates.

 To do this, open your Start menu, then type "Check for updates" in the search bar. Afterward, click on the search result and install any pending updates found. Once you have done so, restart your computer, and Command Prompt should work properly.

## 5\. Perform a System Restore

 If you have recently made changes to Command Prompt, and they seem to be causing the issue, you can try performing a system restore. This will revert your computer back to a previous point in time when Command Prompt was still working properly.

 Check out our guide on[how to perform a system restore in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/system-restore-factory-reset-work-windows-10/) for information on how to achieve this.

## 6\. Boot Your Computer in Safe Mode

 Sometimes, Command Prompt may not run as an administrator due to issues with other applications or software. To fix this, you can check out our guide on[how to boot your Windows computer into Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/) .

 If you boot into Safe Mode, your computer will run with the most basic settings and drivers, so it can help detect software-related problems that could be causing Command Prompt to fail. While in Safe Mode, try running elevated commands to see if the problem persists.

 If the problem goes away while in Safe Mode, that means that an app or service you disabled is the culprit. As such, you can now begin slowly re-

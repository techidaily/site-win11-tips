## Speedy Cross-Language Switching: Hotkeys in Windows 10/11

 Sometimes you may need to translate content from foreign websites or documents to your native language; most users probably rely on translation features integrated within Google and Microsoft software. The MS Office apps incorporate a built-in translator feature, and you can utilize cloud-based Microsoft and Google translators in Edge and Chrome.

 However, there are also some good alternative translator tools you can utilize across all Windows software. QTranslate and DeepL are two utilities with which you can translate text by pressing hotkeys. This is how you can add translate text passages with those appsâ€™ hotkeys in Windows 11/10.

3. Press File Explorerâ€™s button (the one with a folder library icon) on your taskbar.

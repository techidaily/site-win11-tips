 This will take some minutes to redownload and replace any missing or corrupted game files. Simply wait for the process to complete. After that, you can launch Valheim and check if the stuttering and freezing are frequent.

 After restarting Steam, it should check for an update especially after the next time you launch Valheim.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 Graphical glitches or other performance issues such as freezing and stuttering may be caused by an outdated or corrupted graphics driver. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now as it would fix your issue with no hassle.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

## 4\. Run your game as administrator

 Sometimes, programs might not function properly just because they lack the administrative rights. The same could apply to your Valheim. To check if that’s your case, you should run Valheim as an administrator:

 1) Open your Steam Client. Under the **LIBRARY**  tab, find your game title and right-click it. Then select **Manage > Browse local files** . This will bring you to the game’s installation folder.  
  
![run Valheim as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/browse-local-file-1.png)

 2) Find the valheim.exe file. Right-click it and select**Properties** .  
  
![run Valheim as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/administrator-propertities.png)

</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1061528/11832" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Select the**Compatibility** tab. Check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** .  
  
![run Valheim as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apply-okay.png)

 After applying the changes, launch Vaheim to see if this helps you get rid of stutters and freezes during the gameplay. If running as an administrator didn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Stop overclocking

 Some players may use GPU tweaking programs such as MSI Afterburner to hopefully get a performance increase. But there are some titles that don’t really support cards that are overclocked. Otherwise, your game would suffer and it may be getting to the point that your Valheim is unplayable. Therefore, we suggest you stop overclocking.

---

## 6\. Close unnecessary programs

 Programs such as Google Chrome and Adobe apps are resource-heavy and will most likely drain your system. To guarantee that you can get the best gaming experience, you should close those programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Valheim. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **taskmgr** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
  
![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Under the **Processes** tab, right-click on the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Valheim and select **End task** .

![disable programs running in the background Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War crashing on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-programs-running-in-the-backgroundend-task.jpg)

 After you’ve done these, try to play Valheim to check if your game still stutters or freezes.

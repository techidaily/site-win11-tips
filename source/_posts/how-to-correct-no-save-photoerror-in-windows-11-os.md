## How to Correct 'No Save' PhotoError in Windows 11 OS

 Many users capture webcam photos with the pre-installed Windows 11/10 Camera app. However, some users have reported an error code that appears when they click on Windows Camera’s "take photo" button that reads “0xA00F424F <PhotoCaptureFileCreationFailed> (0x80131500).”

 The code’s error message says, “Sorry, we weren’t able to save the photo.” As you might expect, the Camera app won't save any new photos when this error appears. As such, this is how you can fix the “photo capture file creation failed” error on Windows.

## 1\. Check the Camera Access Permission Settings

 First, check that webcam access permission is set for the Camera app. This is how you can enable apps to access the webcam in Windows:

1. Click **Settings** on your Start menu.
2. Select the **Privacy** tab/category.
3. Click on **Camera** to view app permission settings for the webcam.

4. Toggle on the **Let apps access your camera** (or **Allow apps**) setting.  
![The Let apps access your camera setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/let-apps-access-your-camera.jpg)
5. Turn on the switch for the **Camera** app setting.

## 2\. Reset the Windows Camera
![The Reset button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reset-button.jpg)

 Windows has a **Reset** troubleshooting option for fixing apps that aren’t working right. Resetting the Windows Camera app will clear its data. That’s worth a try since it’s a straightforward potential fix to apply.

 Our guide on [how to reset a Window app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) includes instructions for applying this potential fix in Windows 11 and 10\.

## 3\. Create a New Camera Roll Folder

 The “photo capture file creation failed” error can occur because the Camera Roll folder has been deleted. Users confirm creating a new Camera Roll folder can fix this issue when the old one has been deleted. You can create a new Camera Roll folder like this:

1. Open File Explorer with the **Win + E** keyboard shortcut.
2. Then go to this folder path:  
`C:\Users\<user folder>\Pictures\`
3. If you can’t find Camera Roll in the Pictures folder or any subfolder there (such as Screenshots), you’ll need to recreate that folder. Right-click inside the Pictures directory and select **New** \> **Folder**.

4. Input **Camera Roll** to be the new folder’s name and press **Enter**.

 Also, check if the Camera Roll folder has been moved out of the Pictures folder to another directory. If it has, moving Camera Roll back into the default Pictures location could also resolve this issue.

## 4\. Set a Different Camera Roll Library Location

1. [Open the Run dialog](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) and input the following path in the **Open** box:  
`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries`
2. Click **OK** to bring up a Libraries directory.
3. Right-click Camera Roll to select **Properties**.

4. Click **Add** on the **Library** tab.
5. Next, select a folder location such as **Downloads**.

1. Right-click inside the Include Folder in the Camera Roll window to select **New** \> **Folder**.
2. Enter **Photo** for the new folder title.
3. Click the **Include folder** button.  
![The Include folder button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/include-folder-button.jpg)

2. Next, type **Default save locations** in the search tool’s box.
3. Select **Default save locations** to bring up those settings.
4. Then click the **New** **photos and videos will be saved** to option.

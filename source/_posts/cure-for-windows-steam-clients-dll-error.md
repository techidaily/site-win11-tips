## Cure for Windows Steam Client's Dll Error

 While accessing Steam is usually a matter of double-clicking the app shortcut on your desktop or selecting it from the Start menu, there can be instances when you run into issues. At times, Steam may fail to open on Windows and display the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error instead.

 If this has happened to you, don’t panic. Here are some effective ways to resolve the annoying error message.

## Bypass the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” Error in Steam With a Quick Workaround

 If you need to access Steam quickly and don’t have time to figure out what’s causing the error, it's possible to bypass Steam’s “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error with a workaround. Simply open Steam and wait for the error message to appear. This time, instead of closing the error message, double-click Steam's shortcut to open it again. The Steam client should start checking for updates and open as usual.

 Of course, this is just a temporary fix. If you are looking to resolve the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error for good, employ the following solutions.

## 1\. Restart the Steam Client

 At times, Steam may encounter issues while launching and fail to load its graphical user interface (GUI) on Windows. As Steam is already running in the background, repeated attempts to open the app may prove fruitless and result in the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error. To fix this, you can try closing the Steam client completely [using the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-windows-task-manager/) and reopening it.

 Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager. In the **Processes** tab, right-click on **Steam** and select the **End task** option from the context menu. Try launching Steam again and see if it works.

## 2\. Delete the SteamUI.dll and libswscale-x.dll Files

 If restarting the Steam client does not help, it’s likely that the SteamUI.dll and the libswscale-x.dll files on your system have become corrupted. If that's the case, you will need to remove these files manually. Doing so will force Steam to download fresh copies of these DLL files the next time you open it.

1. Right-click on the **Steam** shortcut on your desktop and select **Properties**.
2. Under the **Shortcut** tab, click the **Open File Location** button.
3. In the File Explorer window that opens, locate and select the **SteamUI.dll** and **libswscale-x.dll** files.
4. Click the **trash icon** at the top to delete them.  
![SteamUI File in File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steamui-file-in-file-explorer.jpg)

 Reopen Steam after this and see if you get any errors.

## 3\. Delete the Beta File From Steam Directory

 Are you using the beta version of the Steam client? If so, you are likely to experience such errors while using Steam on Windows.

 Since you can not open Steam, you won’t be able to leave the beta program via the in-app settings menu. Fortunately, there’s another way to exit Steam’s beta program and switch to the stable version of the app. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press **Win + E** to [open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. Navigate to the directory where you have installed Steam.
3. Double-click the **package** folder to open it.
4. Locate the **Beta** file within the folder and delete it.

1. Open Steam on your PC.
2. Click the **Steam** menu in the top left corner and select **Settings**.
3. Select **Downloads** from the left sidebar.

2. Right-click on the **Steam** logo and select **Exit Steam**.
3. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.

## 7\. Try Basic Fixes

 Steam’s “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error can also occur due to issues with your Windows computer. So, if the above fixes don’t work, you can try some basic fixes to resolve the error message.

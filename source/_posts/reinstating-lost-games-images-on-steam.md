## Reinstating Lost Games Images on Steam

 Are your Steam game icons missing or blank on your Windows desktop, making it harder to find and play the game you want? Does the issue persist with only a few game icons on your desktop, or does it affect all of them? Even though the problem is straightforward to fix, it's essential to understand the causes first.

 In this article, we'll investigate why Steam game shortcut icons disappear or go blank. We'll also provide some fixes to help you fix the problem.

## Why Are Steam Game Icons on Windows Desktop Blank or Missing?

 Steam game icons disappear or become blank due to issues with the Windows Explorer process, moving the Steam game directory to another location on your drive, an icon cache malfunction, or corrupted game files. Operating system problems can also be responsible for this annoyance.

 If you have missing or blank Steam icons, you should verify the integrity of the game files to repair them, delete the icon cache to create a fresh image, restart Windows Explorer, and relocate the game files to the old directory. When all else fails, you can manually recreate the icons on your desktop.

## Preliminary Checks

 Apply the following preliminary checks before moving on to the main fixes:

1. Restart your Windows device.
2. Ensure that the Steam client is up-to-date. If it isn't, update it.
3. Revert any changes you made to the Steam directory folders on your drives.
4. Update your graphics drivers (see[how to update your graphics drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) for more information).

 If the above fixes don't solve the problem, move on to the following solutions.

## 1\. Restart Windows Explorer

 Windows Explorer provides a graphical user interface for Windows utilities. It enables you to navigate your device and access files and folders. As it also controls the visual display of desktop icons, an issue with the process can cause annoying problems. Therefore, you should close the process in Task Manager and restart it. It may help resolve the issue right away.

To restart Windows Explorer, follow the below steps:

1. Right-click the**Start** button and select**Task Manager** .
2. Right-click on the**Windows Explorer** process and click**End task** .

3. If your Windows desktop icons, taskbar, or other utilities disappear, don't panic.
4. In the Task Manager, click the**Processes** tab and then hit**Run new task** .

5. Click**OK** after typing**"explorer.exe."**

 If restarting the Windows Explorer process fails to fix the Steam games icons, try the next fix.

## 2\. Verify the Integrity of Game Files

 Corrupted game files can also cause Steam icons to disappear. Steam offers users the option of automatically replacing outdated game files with new ones if the game files are corrupted, which is known as verifying the integrity of game files. To run this verification in Steam, follow these steps:

1. Run the Steam client.
2. Locate the game whose icon is missing on your desktop.
3. Right-click on the game and select**Properties** .
4. Go to the**Local Files** tab in the left sidebar.
5. Click on**Verify integrity of game files** .

 Let the process complete and check whether it has returned the game icons to normal. If it makes no difference, go to the next fix.

## 3\. Delete the IconCache File

 The IconCache file stores all your icons and maintains their visual display. When displaying the icons, Windows retrieves them directly from the cache rather than from the main application. When the cache file malfunctions, Windows cannot fetch the icons properly, so blank or missing icons are displayed.

 To ensure that this is not the case, you can restore IconCache. This may fix the Steam game icon issue. Follow the below steps to restore it:

1. Go to the following path:  
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local`
2. Find the**IconCache** file.
3. Right-click on the file and select**Delete** .  
![Deleting the IconCache File by Right-clicking on the File in Windows File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-deleting-the-iconcache-file-by-right-clicking-on-the-file-in-windows-file-explorer.jpg)
4. Again, restart Windows Explorer by following the steps mentioned in step one.

If rebuilding the icon cache doesn't work, try the next fix.

 The AppData folder in Windows is often hidden, so you should unhide the files before deleting the IconCache file. Those unfamiliar with the process will find our[guide to on how to show hidden files and folders on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-show-hidden-files-folders/) helpful.

## 4\. Restore the Icons Manually

 If the above fixes do not resolve the problem, you should restore the game icons manually. Although this fix will work, manually restoring game icons can be time-consuming. As such, follow these steps to restore the Steam game icon on your desktop:

1. Run the Steam client.
2. Locate the game whose icon is missing on your desktop.
3. Right-click on the game and select**Properties** .
4. Go to the**Local Files** tab in the left sidebar.
5. In the right pane, click the**Browse** button.  
![Clicking on the Browse Button in the Local Files Tab of Game Properties in Steam Client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-clicking-on-the-browse-button-in-the-local-files-tab-of-game-properties-in-steam-client.jpg)

1. Copy the address of the game's installation folder.
2. Go to the desktop and find the missing icons.
3. Right-click on the shortcut with the missing icon and select**Properties** .
4. Click on the**Change Icon** button.  
![Clicking on the Change Icon Button in the Properties Window of the Game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/6-clicking-on-the-change-icon-button-in-the-properties-window-of-the-game.jpg)
5. Click on the**Browse** button.

6. Paste the copied path and select the game's .exe file.

7. Then click**Ok** and**Apply** .
8. Finally, hit**OK** .  
![Clicking on the Ok Button after Applying the Changes in the Properties Window of the Game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/8-clicking-on-the-ok-button-after-applying-the-changes-in-the-properties-window-of-the-game.jpg)

 By following the above steps, you can restore the icon. If this fix helps solve the problem, repeat these steps for each missing icon. What if this fix doesn't work as expected?

## 5\. Reinstall the Game

 Lastly, if all the fixes mentioned in the article fail to resolve the problem, you should reinstall the game. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Go to the Steam**Library** .
3. Right-click on the game that has disappeared and go to**Manage > Uninstall.**  
![Uninstalling the Game by Right-clicking on the Game in Steam Library](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/9-uninstalling-the-game-by-right-clicking-on-the-game-in-steam-library.jpg)
4. In the confirmation pop-up, click**Uninstall** again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. Then, delete the remaining files from the game's directory.

 After deleting the existing installation, reinstall the game. When you do that, check the box for**Create desktop shortcut** .

![Checking the Box for Create Desktop Shortcut Option in Game Installation Window in Steam Client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/10-checking-the-box-for-create-desktop-shortcut-option-in-game-installation-window-in-steam-client.jpg)

 As a result, Steam will automatically create a desktop shortcut for your game, allowing you to access it more easily.

## Reworking Records: 6 Windows Applications for Date Revision

 There are times when you might want to change the created/modified date for your files. For example, you could do this so that you can group your files by a certain common date. In some instances, you could change the created/modified date for privacy purposes—especially if you share your PC with others.

 So, let’s check out some of the best apps that can help you change the created/modified date on Windows.

## 1\. TimeStamp Changer

 Once you’ve uploaded a relevant file, you can change its created/modified date and time at the bottom part of the screen. If you want to set the current date and time, click the**Now** button. When you’re done, press the**Change** button to save the changes.

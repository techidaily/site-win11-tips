## Ultimate Weather Tech Selection for Win Devices

 Windows 11 has a built-in weather widget that shows the basic weather info, including temperature, forecast for the upcoming week, and precipitation.

 But a good weather app can do much more. It can give you hurricane or extreme weather alerts and air quality information so that you can plan your outings accordingly. Here are the best weather apps for Windows 10 and 11 to match your purpose and style.

[Windows 11 features a Weather widget](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/weather-widgets-windows-7/) in the bottom left corner of the taskbar. Hover your mouse over or click the Widget icon to view all the widgets.

 The Weather widget displays weather information necessary to plan your day. It shows the temperature for the current region, the lowest and highest temperature for the day and the next few days, and cloud cover information.

 It fetches information from the MSN weather forecast web app. Click on any weather condition to view detailed information on the web app. That said, it is a rudimentary app for those who need to know the temperature for the day and if it will rain.

 To customize the widget, click the three-dots menu and select Customize. Here, you can change the location and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You can use Microsoft’s MSN Weather app for Windows if you need more.

## The Best Weather App for Windows 10 and 11

 But a good weather app can do much more. It can give you hurricane or extreme weather alerts and air quality information so that you can plan your outings accordingly. Here are the best weather apps for Windows 10 and 11 to match your purpose and style.

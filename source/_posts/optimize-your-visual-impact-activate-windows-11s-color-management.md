## Optimize Your Visual Impact - Activate Windows 11'S Color Management

 Auto Color Management is a new Windows feature that improves the digital image color quality and makes them appear more natural. It's almost like having an exclusive onsite color specialist right at your fingertips.

 This remarkable tool has been made available in Windows 11's 25309 build, but if you don't have this version yet, you can use a third-party application called ViveTool instead. Read this guide to learn how to enable Auto Color Management for apps in Windows 11\.

## How to Enable Auto Color Management for Apps in Windows 11

 The Auto Color Management feature is currently in beta testing. It is only available in Windows Insider builds 25309 and above. If you want to enable this feature on your system, you will first need to [update to the latest Canary channel build](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-windows-insider-canary-channel/) and then [download ViVeTool from the GitHub page](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases).

 Now open the Command Prompt with administrative rights. If you need help, see our detailed tutorial on [how to run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).

 Once you're in the Command Prompt window, run the following command:

Cd C:\Path

 In the above command line, remember to change **Path** with the actual path of the folder containing ViveTool. For example, if you have extracted the zip file into the C drive folder with the name **ViveTool**, then your command should read **cd C:\\ViveTool**.

 Now run the following command to enable Auto Color Management for apps in Windows 11:

vivetool /enable /id:36371531

 Once you execute the command, you will be prompted with a message that says "Successfully set feature configuration(s)". After that, restart your computer and follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to [open the Settings menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Then navigate to **System > Display**.
3. Scroll down to Related settings and click **Advanced display**.

## Windows Settings Now Includes Auto Color Management

 With the release of Windows Insider builds 25309, you will get a new feature called Auto Color Management feature in your Windows settings. You can use it for multiple activities such as photo editing and graphic design.

## A Step-by-Step Through to Windows 11 Security Control Screen

 When managing user accounts and permissions on Windows, the Authorization Manager tool is an essential part of the process. It allows you to set security settings for specific users or groups as well as view and manage existing user roles.

 Once you learn how to open Authorization Manager on Windows 11, you can access its features and make the necessary changes to help secure it. Here we will look at different methods for opening the Authorization Manager tool on a Windows PC.

## 1\. Use Windows Search

 Windows Search Tool is an incredibly powerful and convenient search utility available on all versions of the Windows operating system. It can be used to quickly locate any file or folder on your computer, so you'll never have a hard time finding what you need.

To access the Authorization Manager, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + S** on your keyboard to open the Search tool.
2. Type "azman.msc" in the search box.

 You should now see the Authorization Manager window in the search results. Click on the result to launch the app.

## 2\. Use Run Dialog Box

 Another way to open the Authorization Manager in Windows is through the Run dialog box. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to [open the Run command dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) .
2. Type azman.msc and press**Enter** to launch the Authorization Manager.

 With this approach, you don't have to browse through multiple menus or folders and can begin managing your computer's authorization settings in a moment.

## 3\. Use Windows File Explorer

 Windows File Explorer is a handy tool to manage your files and folders, allowing you to view, create, move, rename, delete, and organize files. It is also the gateway to accessing hidden files and system settings. Here's how to open Authorization Manager:

1. Right-click on**Start** and select**File Manager** . You can also press**Win + E** on your keyboard to open the tool directly.
2. In the File Explorer address bar, type**azman.msc** and hit**Enter** .

## 4\. Use the Command Prompt and PowerShell

 You may be familiar with the command prompt if you’re a system administrator or an advanced user. To open Authorization Manager using this tool, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on**Start** and select**Run** from the menu that appears.
2. Type**cmd** in the dialog box and press**Enter** .

3. In the Command Prompt, type**azman.msc** and press**Enter** .

 This will instantly open the Authorization Manager window on your computer screen. The same command will also work if you launch and execute it in Windows PowerShell.

## 5\. Use the Task Manager

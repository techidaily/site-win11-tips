## A Step-by-Step Through to Windows 11 Security Control Screen

 When managing user accounts and permissions on Windows, the Authorization Manager tool is an essential part of the process. It allows you to set security settings for specific users or groups as well as view and manage existing user roles.

 Once you learn how to open Authorization Manager on Windows 11, you can access its features and make the necessary changes to help secure it. Here we will look at different methods for opening the Authorization Manager tool on a Windows PC.

2. Type azman.msc and press**Enter** to launch the Authorization Manager.

 With this approach, you don't have to browse through multiple menus or folders and can begin managing your computer's authorization settings in a moment.

## 3\. Use Windows File Explorer

 Windows File Explorer is a handy tool to manage your files and folders, allowing you to view, create, move, rename, delete, and organize files. It is also the gateway to accessing hidden files and system settings. Here's how to open Authorization Manager:

1. Right-click on**Start** and select**File Manager** . You can also press**Win + E** on your keyboard to open the tool directly.

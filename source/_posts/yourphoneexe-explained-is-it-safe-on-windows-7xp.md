1. Press the **Win** key and type **PowerShell**.
2. Next, right-click on **PowerShell** from the search results and select **Run as administrator**.
3. In the PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.YourPhone -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage`
4. Once the command is executed, it’ll remove the Phone Link app from your computer.

 You can re-install the Phone Link app from the Microsoft Store if you want to give the app another shot.

## Is YourPhone.exe a Virus or Trojan?

## What Is the YourPhone.exe (PhoneExperienceHost.exe) Process?

 The Phone Link (YourPhone.exe) is a legitimate process related to the Phone Link (formerly Your Phone) app. It is a handy utility that lets you [connect your iPhone and Android device to your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-phone-link-guide/), receive notifications, make calls, record screens, etc.

 Even when you are not actively using it, the process runs in the background with minimal effect on system performance. It also needs to connect to your network to work with your phone and sync notifications.

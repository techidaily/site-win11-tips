## What Is the “This Device Is Disabled (Code 22)” Error on Windows?

 When you connect an external device to your computer for the first time, Windows installs the driver that is compatible with the device. The device driver then establishes a connection between the removable device and Windows. This allows Windows to identify the device and use it properly.

 However, if you accidentally disable the device driver or it becomes corrupted, the external device will not work properly and may display the error code 22\.

 The error typically occurs when the device driver is disabled or corrupted. However, below are a few other reasons that can trigger this error on Windows:

* An outdated device driver can cause various issues, including error code 22\.
* The error can also crop up if the device isn't compatible with your version of Windows.
* If the device is physically damaged or malfunctioning, Windows will fail to recognize it and throw the error at hand.

 Now that you have a brief knowledge about the "this device is disabled (Code 22)" error, let's explore solutions that will help you fix it.

## 1\. Enable the Device in the Device Manager

 One of the simplest ways to fix error code 22 is to manually enable the device throwing the error. To do that, open the **Device Manager** (check how to [launch Device Manager on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/)), right-click on the problematic device, and choose **Properties**. Then, click the **Enable Device** button.

![Enable device option in Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/enable-device-option.jpg)

 The Device Manager will refresh, and the device will be back online. Check if you still get the error message. If yes, try the next solution on the list.

## 2\. Check for Physical Damage on the Device

 The error message can also stem from physical damage to your device. To confirm this, look for cracks, dents, or other signs of damage on the device. If you are using a connector, make sure it isn't bent out of shape..

 You should also look for signs of liquid damage, such as corrosion or discoloration on your device. If you find any physical damage, it is likely the culprit behind the error message. In this case, the best thing you can do is to replace the device.

## 3\. Update Your Device Driver

 If your device driver is outdated or corrupt, you may be more likely to experience hardware device issues, such as error code 22\. The solution, in this case, is to update your device driver.

 To do this, open the **Settings app**. On the left side of the window, select **Windows Update**. Then, click the **Check for updates** button.

 Windows comes with several troubleshooters that can help you fix different problems. One of them is the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, which, as the name suggests, helps to fix hardware issues.

`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`

## 7\. Perform a Clean Boot

 The next solution on the list is to [perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). This will help you rule out third-party applications that might be causing the error.

 After performing a clean boot, your computer will start in a clean state. To check if the error message still appears, try using the device causing the problem. If it doesn't appear, it's time to narrow down the suspects.

 To do that, start re-enabling the services you disabled for performing the clean boot until the error returns. Once you find the problematic service, consider uninstalling it or downloading its update.

## 8\. Perform a System Restore

 If you are still struggling with the error, you can [try a system restore on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/) to see if that fixes your problem. This will restore your computer to a prior point in time, which is useful if the issue started recently.

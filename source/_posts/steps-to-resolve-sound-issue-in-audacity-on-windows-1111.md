## Steps to Resolve Sound Issue in Audacity on Windows 11/11

 Audacity is great music editing and recording software when it works. However, some users can’t utilize Audacity because of an Internal PortAudio error that occurs when they launch the software. Instead of launching, Audacity throws up this message: “Could not find any audio devices… Internal PortAudio error.”

 Although the Audacity window opens, users can’t play or record anything with that software when the Internal PortAudio error occurs. Does the same thing happen when you run Audacity? If it does, this is how you can fix the Internal PortAudio error in Windows 11 and 10.

1. Click a search box or magnifying glass icon on the Windows 11/10 taskbar.
2. Then type in**Control Panel** within the search utility.
3. Select**Control Panel** to open that app’s window.
4. If Control Panel opens in its category view, click**Large icons** on the**View by** menu.
5. Select**Troubleshooting** to access that applet.

## 2\. Enable the Windows Audio and Endpoint Builder Services

 Many Audacity users have confirmed enabling and running disabled Windows Audio and Endpoint Builder services can fix the Internal PortAudio error. So, this troubleshooting method will likely work if one of those services is disabled on your PC. This is how you can check and enable those services in Windows 11/10:

1. First, bring up the Windows search box and search for Services. You can also use one of the other[ways to open Services on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-services-app/) .
2. Next, double-click**Windows Audio** to bring up further options for that service.

![The Automatic service option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/automatic-service.jpg)
4. Then select the properties window’s**Start** option to run the service.
5. Click**Apply** and**OK** to save the options and exit the Audio Properties window.

 If you find the above services to be enabled and running, restarting them could also feasibly fix the issue. To do that, click Stop in their properties windows and select**Yes** to confirm. Then click their**Start** options to restart them.

## 3\. Manually Enable all Playback and Recording Devices

 It could be the case that a disabled audio playback or recording device is causing the PortAudio error to arise. For that reason, it’s recommended to enable all disabled playback and recording devices you can find in the Sound window. You can do that with the following steps:

1. To access the Run dialog, press**Win + R** .
2. Type**mmsys.cpl** in Run’s command box.
3. Click**OK** to bring up the Sound window.
4. Then click the**Playback** tab if necessary.
5. Right-click any disabled playback device and select**Enable** . Repeat this step for all disabled devices listed.

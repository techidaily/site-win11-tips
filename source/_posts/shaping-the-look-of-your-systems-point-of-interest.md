 There's a lot you can do to change your cursor. For example, you can entirely change the cursor type, tweak the cursor scheme, or even modify the cursor color or speed.

If you want something totally unique, you can even[import a custom mouse cursor on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-custom-mouse-cursor/) .

1. Open the Settings menu by pressing the**Windows Key + I** shortcut.
2. Head to**Devices > Mouse** .
3. Select**Change other mouse options** .
4. Now, use the**Cursor speed** slider and adjust how fast (or slow) the cursor can move.

 On the next page, you'll get three different sections from where you can tweak your mouse settings:

1. Mouse pointers
2. Control the mouse with the keyboard
3. Make it easier to manage Windows

 From the**Mouse pointers** section, you can change the color and size of mouse pointers that will be more suitable for your personalized settings; Regular White, Large Black, Extra Large Inverting, etc., are just some of the designs to pick from.

 Next, the**Control the mouse with the keyboard** section lets you turn on your mouse keys, which basically means you can move your mouse around with the numeric keypad itself.

 Similarly, when you check the radio box for**Turn on Mouse Keys** , you'll be able to use a numeric keypad to move the mouse around the screen.

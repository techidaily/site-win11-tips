## A Comprehensive Guide: Restoring the Non-Responsive Service Control Panel

 Your Windows device uses various services to ensure that the system runs smoothly. For example, there’s a service that checks for software updates and another that allows you to share files. Fortunately, if your Windows services run into issues, you can repair them using the Services tool.

 However, there are instances when the Services tool might suddenly become unresponsive. In this article, we’ll cover some ways to fix the Services tool when it won’t open or respond.

## 1\. Quick Fixes for an Unresponsive Windows Services Tool

 In most cases, you can fix an unresponsive Services app by restarting your device.

 Alternatively, try tackling the issue by running the Services app with administrator privileges. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Type**Services** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the**Best match** result and select**Run as administrator** .

## 2\. Sign Into Your Device Using a Different Microsoft Account

 In some cases, the issue at hand might be specific to the account you’re using. If you have multiple accounts on your device, sign into a different account and see if that helps.

Here’s how you can sign in to a Microsoft account on Windows:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the settings window.
2. Select**Accounts** from the menu items.
3. Select**Email & accounts** on the left-hand side pane.
4. Click the**Add a Microsoft account** option on the right and then follow the on-screen instructions.

## 3\. Access the Services Tool in Safe Mode

 Do you suspect that the issue at hand might be caused by faulty programs? If so, you should consider running the Services tool in Safe Mode. That way, all your third-party apps (including the faulty ones) will be disabled when the device boots up.

Here are the steps for running the Services tool in safe mode:

1. Type**Settings** in the Start Menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Select**Update & Security** and then click the**Recovery** option.
3. Click the**Restart Now** button below the Advanced Startup option. This will restart your PC in the Recovery Environment.

![Installing Programs in Safe Mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-Installing-Programs-in-Safe-Mode.jpg)

 Next, click**Advanced options** and select**Startup Settings** . From there, press the**Restart** button and then press the**F4** key to boot your PC into Safe Mode.

 Now, try opening the Services tool. If you no longer run into problems, then it’s safe to say that a faulty software program is causing the issue at hand. Now you'll need to find the problematic app and update or remove it.

## 6\. Use the DISM and SFC Tools

 If you’re dealing with stubborn malware or corruption, then a simple system scan might not be enough. In such instances, you’d need to use reliable features such as the DISM and SFC tools.

Here's how to run the DISM tool:

1. Type**Command Prompt** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the**Best match** result and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth`
4. When this scan is complete, type the following command and then press**Enter** :  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`

Restart your PC once the scan is complete.

Now, you can now run the SFC tool through these steps:

1. Open the**Command Prompt** by following the previous steps.
2. Type the following command and then press**Enter** :  
`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for this process to complete and then close the Command Prompt. Finally, restart your computer to save these changes.

## 7\. Reset Windows

![A lady using a Windows PC while holding a cup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-lady-using-a-Windows-PC-while-holding-a-cup.jpg)

 By now, the Services tool should be up and running. But if the issue persists, then you might consider resetting your device.

 When you reset Windows, the system will be restored to its factory settings, but your data will be safe. But to be on the safe side, consider [backing up your Windows device to the cloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-computer-cloud/) first before resetting it.

1. Press**Win + I** to open the system settings.

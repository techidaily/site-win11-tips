## Adjusting to Life Without Official Windows XP, 7, or 8.1 Support

 January 10, 2023, marks the end of Microsoft's support for Windows 7 and 8.1\. That means Microsoft will no longer release security and bug updates for these Windows versions from now on.

 But what does this mean for you? As it turns out, the "end of support" for Windows 7 and 8.1 goes deeper than just a lack of updates.

## What Does "End of Support" Mean on Windows?

 When Microsoft ends support for a particular operating system, it no longer releases any updates for it—security patches, bug fixes, or otherwise. That means computers with these operating systems will not receive any protection from new threats, nor will they get updates to ensure that these systems run smoothly with the latest drivers.

 Windows 7, which launched in 2009, actually ceased to have mainstream support in 2015\. However, due to its popularity, Microsoft extended it to 2020\. It then further extended security updates for Windows 7 until 2023 to give corporate users more time to upgrade to Windows 10 or 11.

 On the other hand, Windows 8.1, launched in 2013, had its mainstream support end in 2018\. Again, to give its customers time to upgrade, Microsoft extended support for Windows 8.1 until 2023\. However, given that [Windows 8 was an unpopular OS](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-8-fail-retrospective/) , it didn't have as many users as its predecessor, which made it unlikely for Microsoft to provide additional extensions for its support.

 Now that Microsoft is no longer releasing updates for both of these operating systems, it's high time that their users upgrade to Windows 10 or 11\. That way, they can ensure the security and smoothness of their computers.

## What Should You Do If Your Computer Is Still on Windows 7 or 8.1?

 If your computer is still running either of these operating systems, you should upgrade it to Windows 10\. Luckily, Microsoft still provides [free Windows 10 upgrades to Windows users](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/can-still-upgrade-windows-10-free/) . You also don't need to upgrade your hardware, as Windows 7 and Windows 10 have the same system requirements.

 Alternatively, you can replace your Windows 7 with other [free Windows alternatives](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-alternatives-to-windows-operating-systems/) . You can use Linux, Chromium OS, FreeBSD, and more.

 Or, if you can afford it, why not buy a new laptop or PC instead? Several [great budget laptops you can buy](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-laptops-under-500/) run Windows 11, ensuring you can get the latest security patches and cover your most basic needs.

## What Could Happen to Your PC If You Don't Upgrade to Windows 10 or 11?

 If you choose to stay with Windows 7 or 8.1, you'll likely encounter several problems. Here are a few of the possible issues you might encounter:

### 1\. Your Computer's Security Could Become Compromised
![anonymous hooded figure on laptop hidden by question mark](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/question-mark-anon.jpg)

 The biggest issue with the lack of security updates is that your data is more vulnerable. Without the security patches, anything saved on your computer—like your personal data, financial information, and files—can be stolen or leaked online.

 It may not happen immediately, but since Microsoft is no longer continuously monitoring Windows 7 and 8.1, any future security problems and bugs discovered will no longer be fixed. Threat actors can then use these vulnerabilities to target computers that still run these operating systems.

### 2\. You Can't Use the Latest Versions of Chromium-Based Browsers Anymore
![Chrome Edge and Vivaldi](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Chrome-Edge-Vivaldi.jpg)

 Google announced in [Google Chrome Help](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/185534985/sunsetting-support-for-windows-7-8-1-in-early-2023?hl=en) that Chrome 109 is the last version of Chrome that'll support Windows 7 and 8.1\. Given that some of the most popular browsers today, like Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, use this as a base, you can no longer use the latest versions of these browsers.

 While you can still use older versions of Chrome and Edge, these won't have the latest features and security protections. Furthermore, as companies release newer versions of their browsers, you can expect older ones to get less and less stable.

### 3\. You Might Encounter Issues Running Newer Peripherals and Hardware
![webcam error](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/webcam-error.jpg)

 Since Microsoft is stopping support for Windows 7 and 8.1, it also no longer makes sense for hardware manufacturers to create drivers for these operating systems to support their products.

 While most keyboards and mice will run no matter what Windows operating system you have, more advanced hardware, like webcams and game controllers, might not work with an older operating system.

### 4\. You Can't Run Some of the Latest Apps and Games
![Call of duty modern warfare 2](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2--2.jpg)

 Image Credit:[Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/10/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-release-live-worldwide-now)

 While many apps and games are typically made for the lowest common hardware, you generally can't run newer, more powerful software on older operating systems. For example, you can run popular games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2 on Windows 7 and 8.1.

 But if you want to play PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, you must have at least a Windows 10 PC. You also need an updated operating system to run Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office 2021, and Adobe Creative Cloud apps.

## It's Time to Upgrade Your Windows 7 or 8.1 PC

 We had a good run with Windows 7, although not so much with Windows 8.1\. Nevertheless, it's time to upgrade our operating systems, given that these Windows versions are 14 and 10 years old, respectively.

 By updating to Windows 10 or 11, not only will you get updated security, but you'll also get to enjoy the various quality-of-life improvements these operating systems offer.

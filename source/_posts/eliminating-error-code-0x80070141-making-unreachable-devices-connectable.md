The error 0x80070141 message says, “An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file… the device is unreachable.” Users can’t directly copy images or videos from their mobiles to Windows computers.

 When users can’t transfer files from mobiles to PCs, they can’t view and edit them on Windows PCs. Do you need to fix error 0x80070141 on your PC? If yes, this is how to resolve the 0x80070141 Windows 10 and 11 error.

## 1\. Utilize the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

## 2\. Connect Your Mobile to a Different USB Port

 There could be an issue with one of your PC’s USB ports. To check if that’s the case, try connecting your iPhone with a different USB slot on your PC. For example, plug your phone’s cable into a USB 2.0 slot instead of a USB 3.0 one.

## 3\. Try a Different USB Cable

 A few users who’ve fixed error 0x80070141 have said they needed to change USB cables for connecting their phones. So, closely inspect the condition of your USB cable. If you have an alternative USB cable, try connecting your Apple mobile to your PC with it.

## 4\. Select the Keep Originals Option on Your iPhone

 Selecting the **Download and Keep Originals** iPhone option is one of the most widely confirmed fixes for error 0x80070141\. That option will transfer image files in their original HEIC format when selected. You can select **Keep Originals** on your iPhone like this:

1. Turn on your iPhone and tap Settings.
2. Select **Photos** in Settings.
3. Then select the **Keep Originals** transfer setting.

Select **Get** within the HEIF Image Extensions MS Store window.

## 5\. Shorten Long File Titles

2. Then [open the Explorer file manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and select your connected iPhone.
3. Right-click a file with a long name stored on your iPhone and select **Rename**.

5. Then right-click the shortened file to select **Copy**.
6. Press **Ctrl** \+ **V** within a folder on your Windows PC to transfer it.

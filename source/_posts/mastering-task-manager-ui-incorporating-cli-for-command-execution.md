 The Processes tab in Task Manager displays a list of all running processes. However, by default, it does not show the command line arguments used by those processes.

 Accessing the command line arguments can be essential for eliminating issues. For instance, if you're trying to [fix a high CPU usage on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-high-cpu-usage-windows/), you can examine the command line arguments to check the command used to initiate a CPU-hungry process.

 Additionally, malware often exploits command-line arguments to spread throughout a computer. By inspecting the command line tab in Task Manager, you can identify processes using suspicious command line arguments.

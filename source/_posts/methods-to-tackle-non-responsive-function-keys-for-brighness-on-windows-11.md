## Methods to Tackle Non-Responsive Function Keys for Brighness on Windows 11

 You may usually get eye strain or headaches when the brightness of your laptop or PC monitor is too low. Issues like this can be easily solved by adjusting the brightness with a simple press of the brightness function key.

 However, things get tricky if this key does not work anymore or has stopped functioning. In such cases, you may need to take a few steps in order to fix the brightness function key not working on Windows PC.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 Keyboard issues can sometimes be fixed with a simple restart. Restarting your computer will reset the keyboard settings and may make the brightness key work again.

## 2\. Clean Your Keyboard to Remove Dirt and Grime

## 3\. Make Sure the Function Key Is Enabled

 The function key may not work if it is disabled on your keyboard. To make sure it is enabled, press the**Fn + Esc** keys simultaneously. Doing this will toggle the function lock on and off. If it was disabled, enabling it should help fix the brightness key not working issue.

## 4\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 The Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter is the next step to try if the above solutions weren't enough. This tool can detect and fix any hardware and device issues on your computer, including the problem with the keyboard. To run the troubleshooter, do the following:

 Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Once you've done this, restart your computer and check if the issue is resolved.

 If the Fn key is still unresponsive even with a driver update, there may be problems with your keyboard's driver. In that case, uninstall the problematic driver and install it again. Here's how to do it:

 After performing the above steps, restart your computer to reinstall the drivers. Once you power up again, check if the function key works now.

## 7\. Turn Off the Filter Keys

 Filter keys on Windows are designed to ignore repeated keystrokes and slow down the rate at which a key repeats when held down. It is intended to help users who have difficulty pressing keys on a keyboard.

5. Click**Apply** and then**OK** .

Now check if your keyboard is working properly.

## 8\. Scan for Malicious Programs

 To make sure it isn't the case, you can [check if a file is infected with a virus or not](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-suspicious-file-malware/) . In case you find one, you need to [scan your computer for viruses and then remove them](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/) .

 This should help you fix the issue of your keyboard not functioning properly.

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.

## Securing Steam Service: Tackling Errors on Windows 11

 Are you encountering an error box titled "Steam service error" when attempting to launch the Steam client on your computer? There could be various reasons behind this issue, ranging from insufficient permissions to Windows firewall settings.

 If you've already restarted the Steam client and eliminated internet-related problems without success, it's time to explore more advanced solutions. Here are some ways to effectively troubleshoot the Steam service error.

## 1\. Check the Steam Client Service Status

 Before trying any advanced solutions, be sure to verify the status of the Steam client service. Doing this will help you confirm whether the error message is a result of a server outage.

 To check the status of Steam servers, navigate to the [Steam entry on the Downdetector website](https://downdetector.com/status/steam/). If the results indicate that the Steam servers are currently undergoing maintenance or experiencing downtime, it's recommended to wait until they become operational again before using Steam.

## 2\. Launch the Steam Client With Administrative Permissions

 Often, the Steam client might fail to function correctly and display a service error due to insufficient administrative permissions. In this case, you can resolve the problem by launching the Steam client with administrative privileges.

 To do that, right-click the **Steam app** and choose **Run as administrator.** If the [User Account Control](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/user-account-control-windows-10/) prompt appears, click **Yes** to confirm your selection.

 Subsequently, Steam will run with elevated privileges. Check if you still encounter the error message.

## 3\. Allow Steam to Run Through the Windows Firewall

 Steam must be able to access the internet to function correctly on your system. However, if the Steam client is blocked under the Windows firewall settings, it will fail to access the internet, leading to a service error.

 In this case, you will have to allow the Steam client to run through the Windows firewall. Here's how to do it.

1. Press the **Win** key to open the Start Menu, type **Windows Security** in the search bar, and press **Enter**.
2. Choose **Windows Security** from the left sidebar and **Allow an app through firewall** in the right pane.  
![Allow an app through firewall option in Windows Security](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/allow-an-app-through-firewall.jpg)
3. Click **Change** **settings.**
4. Check **Private** and **Public** boxes for Steam. Then, click **OK**.

 Following these steps, launch the Steam client and check if the issue persists.

## 4\. Change Steam Client Service Status

 The Steam client service ensures that the Steam client loads properly on your computer. Usually, this service initiates whenever you launch the Steam client. However, if it fails to do so, it results in a Steam service error.

 In this case, the solution is to set the startup type status of the Steam client service to automatic, ensuring that the service launches automatically whenever you open the Steam client. You can change the service status by following these instructions:

1. Press **Win + R** keys together to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **services.msc** in the search bar and press **Enter**.
3. Right-click on **Steam Client Service** and choose **Properties**.

4. Choose **Automatic** from the **Startup** **type** drop-down menu.

## 5\. Repair Steam Service Client

 If changing the startup type of the Steam service client wasn't helpful, the issue likely resides within the service itself. In this case, you'll have to use the built-in repair option to repair the Steam service client.

 To do that, open **Command Prompt** with administrative privileges (see how to [launch Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/)), type the following command, and press **Enter**.

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin\SteamService.exe /repair`

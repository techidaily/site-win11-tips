## How to Avoid Discord Starting with System Boots Up

 Discord's desktop client launches and checks for updates at Windows startup, which can be annoying for users. This happens because Discord adds an update process to the startup folder during installation, and its settings are configured to launch the app at Windows startup.

 If you're tired of Discord launching and looking for updates at every startup, we'll show you how to stop it on Windows.

 The above steps will prevent Discord from launching at startup. Just like Discord, you can also[add or remove other startup programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-remove-startup-programs-windows-11/) at any time.

 Sadly, the quest to prevent Discord from launching at startup doesn't end here. If Discord's Update process is allowed to run at startup in Task Manager, it may still look for updates and launch. It is, therefore, imperative to disable that as well.

 Following the above steps will prevent Discord from launching at startup and looking for updates. However, ensure you disable the Discord-related Update process in the Task Manager, not any other process. You may get into more trouble if you stop the Windows-related update process.

 Do not perform any actions if you do not see any Update process in Task Manager's Startup tab.

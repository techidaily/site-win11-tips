## Overcoming Save Locations: Windows XP/7/8 Errors

 Users have reported error 0x80070005 or 0x80070539 arises when they try to set new apps to save to different external drive locations with Settings. Those error codes have the same message that says, “We couldn’t set your default save location.” This means users can’t change the default save location for apps.

 Is that error also preventing you from changing where new apps save to? If it is, this is how you can fix error codes 0x80070005 or 0x80070539 on Windows 11/10\.

## 1\. Set Your User Account to Administrator

 If you’re utilizing a standard Windows account, [change your user account type](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-change-user-account-windows-10/) to an administrative one. A standard user account will prevent you from applying any more complicated system changes. Changing the save location for apps is something you might need admin privileges for.

## 2\. Rename the WindowsApps Directory

 This error can arise because the WindowsApps folder where apps save is corrupted. Renaming the WindowsApps folder on the drive or partition you want to save apps can address such an issue. To do so, rename that folder as follows:

1. If you’re trying to set apps to save on an external drive, connect that hard drive to your PC.
2. [Open the File Explorer folder navigator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and click **This PC**.
3. Double-click the drive/partition you want to set as your default save location for apps.
4. Then, right-click on the WindowsApps folder and select its **Rename** context menu option. You should find that directory within the drive’s root directory.

5. Rename the folder to **WindowsApps.old** and press **Enter**.
6. Thereafter, try changing the default save location for apps again via Settings.

 If that still doesn’t work, then proceed to the next resolution.

## 3\. Delete or Rename the WpSystem Folder

 Many users confirm that renaming or deleting the WpSystem folder fixes error 0x80070005\. WpSystem is a folder created to store app data. Try renaming that folder to **WpSystem.old** on the drive you can’t set to be a save location for apps, as outlined for the previous method. The WpSystem will be in the same directory as the WindowsApps folder.

 Alternatively, delete the WpSystem folder. You can [erase a file or folder in Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-delete-select-files/) by right-clicking it and selecting **Delete**. If you can’t find that folder or this potential solution doesn’t work, try the next resolution.

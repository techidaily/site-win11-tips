## How to Start WordPad in a Windows Desktop

 WordPad is a basic word-processing program that comes installed on most Windows PCs. The program allows you to create and edit documents, but it lacks some of the more advanced features of other word-editing applications. Despite its limited features, WordPad can be a helpful tool for quickly creating and editing simple documents.

 If you're new to Windows, you may not know how to open WordPad. Here are some quick and easy ways to launch WordPad on your Windows PC.

## 1\. How to Open WordPad Using the Windows Search Tool

## 4\. How to Open WordPad Using the Task Manager

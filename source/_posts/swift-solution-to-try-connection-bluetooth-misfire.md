## Swift Solution to 'Try Connection' Bluetooth Misfire

 Many users utilize wireless Bluetooth devices with Windows 11/10 PCs. Yet, some users have said they see “Try connecting your device again” or “Try connecting again” error messages in Windows when they try pairing Bluetooth devices. Those similar error messages appear within the Add a device window.

 Consequently, users can’t connect Bluetooth devices like mice, headphones, and speakers because of that issue. It’s an annoying issue that users must get fixed to utilize their Bluetooth devices. This is how you can resolve the “Try connecting your device” error in Windows 11/10.

## 1\. Run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter

 Windows has a Bluetooth troubleshooter that could be useful for fixing the “Try connecting your device” error. That troubleshooter isn’t a guaranteed fix, but it’s worth trying given that it’s designed to resolve Bluetooth issues. You can open the Bluetooth troubleshooter like this:

1. Activate Settings by simultaneously pressing the**Windows** logo +**I** keys on your keyboard.
2. Then select the**System** tab and Troubleshoot to view three navigation options.
3. Click**Other trouble-shooters** to go to the list of troubleshooting utilities.
4. Press the Bluetooth troubleshooter’s**Run** button.

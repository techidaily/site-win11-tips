## 7\. Restart the Windows Installer Service

 Windows Installer is a service for handling the installation of software with MSI packages. It's a service you can try restarting to resolve the “problem with the Windows installer package” error. If it's not running, you can fix this problem by starting it back up again.

 You can restart Windows Installer like this:

1. To open Services, you will need to press **Win + R** to type in a **services.msc** Run command and press **Enter**.
2. Right-click the Windows Installer service and click **Restart** if it’s running, or select the **Start** option if the Windows Installer service is stopped.  
![The Start option for the Windows Installer service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-windows-installer-service-context-menu.jpg)

## 8\. Re-Register the Windows Installer Service

 If restarting the Windows Installer service has had no effect, try re-registering the service. Re-registering a service is somewhat similar to reinstalling it, as you can't uninstall services through regular means.

 This is how you can re-register Windows Installer with a couple of commands:

1. To search for Command Prompt, press **Win + S** and type in "CMD".
2. When the Command Prompt appears in the search, click **Run as administrator** on the right side of the search tool.
3. Type in (or copy and paste) this command and hit **Enter**:  
`msiexec.exe /unregister`

![The unregister service command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-unregister-command.jpg)
4. Execute this command for re-registering Windows Installer:  
`msiexec.exe /regserver`  
![The register service command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-register-windows-installer-command.jpg)
5. Check the Windows Installer service is running and start it again if necessary, as covered in the earlier resolution.

## 9\. Perform a Windows Clean Boot

 Disabling all third-party software and services that start with Windows is called "clean booting". Clean booting might disable some startup items that were conflicting with the installation process. Security programs are the most likely software packages to cause installation issues.

 You can disable startup services and apps via MSConfig and Task Manager, as instructed in our article about [how to clean boot Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). Restart your PC after setting up the clean boot. Then have another go at installing the affected software packages.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![The Services tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-services-tab2.jpg)

 If this resolution solves the issue, you can install the software you currently need and restore the standard boot configuration afterward. However, the error might reoccur in the future when you try to install more software. So, it’s better to try and identify what app or service was causing the issue and keep it disabled.

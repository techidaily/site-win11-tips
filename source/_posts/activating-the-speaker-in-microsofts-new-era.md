## Activating the Speaker in Microsoft's New Era

 Windows comes with a built-in application called Narrator that reads aloud text. It can read documents, emails, web pages, and other text that appears on the screen. The Narrator application is also useful for people with visual impairments who need assistance reading text on a screen.

 It has a number of features that make it easy to customize and user-friendly. This article will show you how to access this tool on Windows 11.

 If you're using Windows 11, you can open Narrator by pressing**Win + Ctrl + Enter** on your keyboard. This shortcut will work even if you're in another app or in the middle of a task.

 To stop the Narrator from reading aloud, press**Caps Lock + Esc** .

## 2\. How to Start the Narrator Using a Run Command

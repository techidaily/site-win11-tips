## Amplify Your Digital Experience: Adding Directories to Taskbar Menu

 The context menu is a handy menu you can open in Windows 11 by clicking the right mouse button on the desktop or in File Explorer. That menu consists of two parts in Windows 11, and you can customize its secondary classic menu with registry hacks and third-party software packages in many ways. Here we’ll be looking at how you can add context menu folder shortcuts with the MyFolders and Right Click Context Menu Adder apps.

## How to Add Folders to Windows 11’s Context Menu With MyFolders

You can configure that submenu by adding folder shortcuts to it for opening with Explorer or Command Prompt. Its submenu also includes some additional folder management options. This is how you can add folders to Windows 11’s context menu with MyFolders:

1. First, open the [MyFolders](https://www.coretechnologies.com/products/MyFolders/) webpage.
2. Click the**Download Completely Free** button.

### How to Tweak Right Click Context Menu Adder

 There are a few optional settings you can change when adding folders to the context menu with Right Click Context Menu Adder. To change the shortcut’s position, select a different**Position on Menu** option.

 You can change the shortcut's label by entering something different in the**Text On Menu** box. If you select**Show only when Shift key** is pressed, the shortcut will only be visible if you activate the context menu with the**Shift** key pressed.

 An**Enable Aero Glass** setting is selected by default in Right Click Context Menu Adder. That setting can make this software’s tab text somewhat unclear in Windows 11\. So, it’s best to disable that option by selecting the**Settings** tab (the third one from the right) and deselecting the**Enable Aero Glass** checkbox. Then the tabs will have clear black text.

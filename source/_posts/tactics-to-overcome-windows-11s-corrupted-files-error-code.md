## 4\. Turn Off Real-Time Antivirus Shields

 Another possible factor for error 0x80070570 occurring is your PC’s antivirus shield is hindering the file operation. That could happen if your antivirus software wrongly flags files you’re trying to transfer between drives as suspicious. So, try temporarily disabling your antivirus shield before performing the required file operation.

 If you don’t have third-party security software, turn off Windows Security’s real-time antivirus shield, as covered in our article about [disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/permanently-disable-microsoft-defender-windows-11/). .

 Users with third-party antivirus utilities will need to turn off their antivirus shields via the apps’ system tray context menus. Right-click the antivirus app’s icon in the system tray and select a disable or turn off shield protection setting.

## Adapt Window's Sleep Timer to Suit You

 The Windows lock screen usually displays images when you power on your device or wake it from sleep mode. By default, the lock screen will only appear for about a minute, and then your screen will go blank.

 Meanwhile, the screen saver is an image or animation that appears when your PC has been inactive for a while. Just like the lock screen, the screen saver will also appear for about one minute.

 Wondering how you can display the lock screen or screen saver for longer?

 This article will show you the various ways to change the Windows lock screen and screen saver timeout settings.

## 1\. How to Change the Lock Screen Timeout Settings

### Use the Command Prompt

 The Command Prompt is a reliable tool that can help you [troubleshoot various Windows system issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-troubleshoot-faulty-windows-pc/). Interestingly, this tool can also help you configure the settings on your device.

 Here’s how to configure the Windows lock screen timeout settings [using the Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/):

 The "**60**" in the command indicates the duration (seconds) in which the lock screen will be displayed. If you want to increase the lock screen duration, apply the previous steps and change "**60**" to a different value of your choice.

 When you finish, type the following command and press **Enter**:

 The Registry Editor can help you tweak the screen-saver timeout settings with ease. But it's quite a sensitive tool, so you should consider [backing up the Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) first before you proceed.

 Locate the **ScreenSaveTimeOut** option on the right-hand side.

 If the key is missing, right-click on a blank space on the right and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**. From there, rename the value as **ScreenSaveTimeOut** and press **Enter**.

 Next, double-click the **ScreenSaveTimeOut** value.

![Clicking the "ScreenSaveTimeOut" value](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/clicking-the-screensavetimeout-value.jpg)

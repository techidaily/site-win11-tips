 Subtitles can be a lifesaver, especially when watching a movie in an unfamiliar language. However, if your Prime Video subtitles aren't working, you'll miss out on important dialogues or plot points. Fortunately, there are various fixes for this problem.

## 1\. Perform Some Basic Fixes

 While most of the content on Prime Video has subtitles, there are exceptions as well. It's possible that subtitles are unavailable for the movie or show you are streaming. To check for that possibility, play the title, click the**Subtitles and Audio** icon at the top, and check if subtitles are available.

 The issue can also appear as a temporary glitch. In this case, you can turn subtitles off and back on to fix the issue. Here's a step-by-step instructions to do that:

1. Play the title on Prime Video and click**Subtitles and Audio** icon at the top.
2. Choose the**Off** option.

3. Wait for a few seconds. Then, turn on the subtitles of your preferred language.

 Another quick way to fix Prime Video subtitles not working is to sign out and then back into your Prime Video account. To do that, click on your account name in the bottom left corner, and choose**Sign out** from the context menu.

## 2\. Eliminate Browser Issues

 If you access Prime Video via the web, your browser's corrupt cache data is probably causing the problem. You'll have to manually[clear your browser's cache data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) to fix the issue.

 Browser extensions usually help to increase productivity. But some extensions can do more harm than good. So,[disable all browser extensions](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/) from your browser and see if that fixes the subtitles not working in Prime Video.

 The problem can also occur due to an issue in the current version of your browser. In this case, you can[update your browser](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-chrome-firefox-edge-desktop-mobile/) to fix the issue.

## 3\. Repair and Reset the Prime Video App

 Windows comes with a Repair function that you can use to eliminate most of the issues with the UWP apps. Here's how to repair the Prime Video app.

1. Press the**Win + I** key to open the**Settings app.**
2. Choose**Apps** from the left sidebar and**Installed Apps** from the right pane.
3. Click the**three dots** next to**Prime Video for Windows** and choose**Advanced options.**
4. Click the**Repair** button.

 Wait till Windows repairs the app. You will see a checkmark next to the repair button when it's done.

 If repairing the app wasn't helpful, you can use the reset option, which will clear all its data. Doing this will be helpful if corrupt Prime Video files are causing the issue. To reset the Prime Video app, click the**Reset** button.

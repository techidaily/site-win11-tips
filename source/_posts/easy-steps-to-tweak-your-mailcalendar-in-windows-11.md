## Why Is the Mail and Calendar App Not Opening on Windows 11?

 One of the primary reasons the Mail and Calendar app is inaccessible on Windows 11 is the corrupt system files. The issue can also occur due to outdated Windows versions and temporary app glitches.

 Fortunately, it's very easy to troubleshoot the problem. Below are all the working fixes you can try in the situation.

## 1\. Restart and Install Updates

 The best thing you can try to eliminate any Windows issue is to restart the computer. If the problem is caused due to a temporary Windows glitch, it will be fixed with a simple restart.

 Additionally, you should ensure that you are running the latest Windows version. Sometimes outdated Windows is often the primary reason behind the inaccessibility of applications. You can download the latest Windows update by following the below steps.

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .
2. Click on**Windows Update** .
3. Click on**Check for updates** .  
![Windows Check for update screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Check-for-updates.jpg)
4. Windows will check for any pending updates and install them if available.

 After updating to the latest OS version, check if you can open the app. If not, move on to the next solutions.

## 2\. Download the Latest Updates for Mail and Calendar

 Similar to Windows' own updates, an outdated Mail and Calendar app can also cause issues. Try updating the app to see if that fixes your problem.

Here's how to update Mail and Calendar on Windows 11.

2. Click on**Library** at the bottom left corner.

5. Download the update available for Mail and Calendar.

 After updating the application, reboot the system and check for the issue.

## 3\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

Here's how to run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter.

 Windows will take a few seconds to repair the app. Once the process is complete, launch the Mail and Calendar, and check if you are still facing the problem.

Here's how to do it.

1. Open Start Menu, type**Windows Security** , and press Enter.
2. Click on**Firewall & network protection** on the left pane.
3. Choose**Allow an app through the firewall** .

7. Click OK to save the changes.

 The third-party antivirus program can also cause the issue. Try to disable it and check if you can access the Mail and Calendar app.

## 9\. Re-Register the Mail And Calendar App

 Re-registering the Mail and Calendar app is another solution you can try in this situation. This method solves issues that lead to inaccessibility and sudden application crashes.

Here's how to register the Mail and Calendar app.

1. [Open the Windows PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) window by clicking on**Start** and typing "windows powershell" in the search bar.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.  
`Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &ldquo;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&rdquo;}`

 Wait until the command is executed. After that, reboot the system, and check for the problem.

## 10\. Remove Corruption From Your Computer

 The problem can occur due to corrupt system files as well. You can eliminate the issue by running a System File Checker, aka SFC scan.

Here are the steps to run an SFC scan.

1. Open**Command Prompt** in Administrator mode by opening the**Start** menu, typing "command prompt,", right-clicking the search result, and selecting**Run as Administrator.**
2. Type**sfc /scannow** and press Enter.

 Now, check if the problem continues. If yes, try running the DISM scan.

 DISM scans the system for inconsistencies that may result from application failure. You can run DISM by going through the steps below.

1. Open Command Prompt in administrator mode.
2. Type the following command and press Enter.  
`DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth`

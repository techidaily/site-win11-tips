 You're probably used to scanning QR codes with your smartphone to access email addresses, phone numbers, and website links. But how do you scan them on a Windows PC without your phone? Let's see.

## 1\. How to Scan QR Codes Using the Windows Camera App

 Microsoft added a QR code scanner to its native camera app for Windows. You can use the app to quickly scan a QR code on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers. Here are the steps for either OS:

1. Click the magnifying icon on the taskbar or press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **camera** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. Click on the arrows to reveal the **Barcode** button below the shutter button (in Photo mode).
4. Place your QR code in front of your computer's camera and the app will scan it automatically.

 It's worth noting that the QR code option in the Camera app may not be visible if you aren't running the most recent version of Windows. In this case, you must enable the experimental features in the Windows Camera app to access the QR code option. Here's how:

1. Open the **Camera** app on your PC using Windows Search. Check out [how to use Windows Search](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) if you need help.
2. Click the gear icon in the top-left corner to open the app's settings.
3. Click **Related settings** to expand it.
4. Enable the toggle next to **Try out new experimental features**.

 Restart the Camera app after completing the above steps, and you should see the QR code scanner option.

## 2\. How to Scan QR Codes From an Image on Windows

 Although the Windows Camera app makes it simple to scan QR codes, it has some limitations. The biggest hurdle is that it can't scan QR codes from existing images on your computer. To do this, you can use an online QR code scanning service. Here's how:

1. Open any web browser and head to the [ScanQR](https://scanqr.org/) website.
2. Under the **Scan QR code from image** section, click the **Drag & Drop or Browse** option.
3. Select the image containing the QR code from your computer and click **Open**.

4. Once you upload the image, the website should scan it automatically and show the result in the **Scanned Data** box. You can copy the result from there if you want.

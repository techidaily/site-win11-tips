 The Blackview MP60 excels as an office PC; perhaps if you've been thrust into remote working a few days a week and only need a little web browsing and Microsoft Teams. It's cheap, goes into your bag without trouble, and you can take your office on the move.

 It isn't going to run any 3D games or high-performance applications like Adobe Premiere, but it'll handle Word just fine, and the safety of Windows 11 Pro will protect you. If you grab it on sale for $150, it’s excellent value. If the price has already gone up to $250-400 by the time you read this, I’d probably think twice.

## Unlocking Accessibility Issues of Purchased Software on MS Marketplace

 The Microsoft Store lets you install verified apps securely from its app store. However, when you try to install an app, you may encounter an error that says "this app couldn’t be installed." This can happen with a specific app or all the apps you want to install.

 The problem can be as simple as a corrupted Microsoft Store cache or issues with system files. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to quickly resolve this error and get Microsoft Store working again.

## 1\. Run the Microsoft Store Troubleshooter ![windows store apps troubleshooter 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/windows-store-apps-troubleshooter-1.jpg)

 You can quickly fix common Microsoft Store problems using the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter. It is a built-in troubleshooting utility that can scan and fix issues preventing the Microsoft Store from installing apps.

2. In the**System** tab, scroll down and click on**Troubleshooter.**
3. Next, click on**Other troubleshooters.**
4. Scroll down and click on the**Run** button for Windows Store Apps. The troubleshooter will perform a scan and recommend fixed. Apply any recommended fixes and check for improvements.

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .

## 4\. Perform a Microsoft Store Repair ![repair microsoft store windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/repair-microsoft-store-windows-11.jpg)

 You can manually reset the Microsoft Store app from the Settings app. The Reset option will delete all the app data, and you may need to log in to use Microsoft Store again.

To reset Microsoft Store:

1. Press**Win + I t** o open**Settings** .

## 6\. Re-register the Microsoft Store App ![powershell re_register microsoft store app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/powershell-re_register-microsoft-store-app.jpg)

 Another way to fix the "this app couldn’t be installed" error is to re-register the Microsoft Store using PowerShell. Here’s how to do it.

1. Make sure**Microsoft Store** is closed.
2. Next, press the**Win key** and type**powershell** .
3. Right-click on**PowerShell** and select**Run as administrator.**
4. In the PowerShell window, type the following command to re-register the app for the current user:  
`Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}`
5. Wait for the command to process and close PowerShell. Relaunch Microsoft Store and check if you can install the app without the error.

## 7\. Reinstall the Microsoft Store

 You can reinstall Microsoft Store to fix issues with the app due to corrupt app files or bugs. Since clearing the cache didn’t help, you can perform a reinstall to resolve the error.

 Note that Microsoft Store is a system app. As a result, you cannot uninstall it from the Settings panel. Instead, you’ll need to use the**Get-AppxPackage** cmdlet in PowerShell to remove and reinstall the app.

 Make sure to [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before uninstalling Microsoft Store. When something goes awry, you can use the restore point to undo the changes and restore your PC to its current state.

To reinstall Microsoft Store:

1. Press the**Win** key and type**powershell** .
2. Right-click on Windows PowerShell and select**Run as administrator.**  
![remove microsoft store powershell](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/remove-microsoft-store-powershell.jpg)
3. Next, in the PowerShell Windows, type the following command and press Enter:  
`get-appxpackage *store |remove-appxpackage`
4. Once the app is removed, use the following command to reinstall Microsoft Store:  
`Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}  

`
5. Wait for the app to install successfully. Then, type**exit** and press**Enter** to close PowerShell.

6. Press**Win** key and type**Microsoft Store** to launch the app.

## Fixing the "This App Couldn’t Be Installed" Error on Windows

 This error is often due to issues with the corrupt app cache and temporary glitches. Use the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter or run the WSreset tool to fix common problems with Microsoft Store. If the issue persists, you can perform a reset or re-register the app to resolve the error.

 That said, if the issue persists with a specific app, you can download the Microsoft Store apps using a third-party service and install them manually on your PC.

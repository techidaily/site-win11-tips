## Navigating Through MKV-to-MP4 Transformation on Windows

 MKV is a multimedia container format that often stores multiple audio and subtitle tracks. However, since it is not as popular as other video file formats, such as MOV and MP4, playing an MKV file can become challenging on a Windows computer.

 If your device doesn’t support the MKV format, you can convert it to MP4\. It is a common multimedia format supported by almost all devices. Here we show you the best online and offline tools to convert MKV to MP4 in Windows.

![cloud convert download](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cloud-convert-download.jpg)
5. Click the **Convert** button to begin the process.
6. CloudConvert will first upload the selected video. Depending on the file size and your Internet speed, this may take some time.
7. Once the video is processed, you will see the video in a preview dialog. Click the **Download** button to save the video to your local hard drive.

 To delete the video from the CloudConvert server, click the small red **X** icon next to your video title. All your videos will be deleted permanently within 24 hours.

 CloudConvert is easy to use, and the 25 free conversions per day make it an ideal tool for occasional conversions. However, if you have privacy concerns, consider using an offline converter to keep your videos in your local drive.

## 3\. Use OBS to Convert MKV to MP4

 A lesser-known OBS feature is its built-in MKV to MP4 converter. OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free and open-source multi-platform tool primarily used for video streaming and game recording.

 As you can tell, OBS is not a conventional video converter. However, since it saves its game and screen recordings in the MKV format, the developers have included a Remux Recordings feature to facilitate quick MKV to MP4 conversions. Here’s how to use it to your advantage to convert your Matroska video files to MP4:

1. [Download and install OBS](https://obsproject.com/welcome) if you don’t have it already installed.
2. Once installed, launch OBS.
3. Click **File** and select **Remux Recordings**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![obs remux recording windows 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/obs-remux-recording-windows-1.jpg)
4. In the **Remux Recordings** dialog, drag and drop your MKV file under **OBS Recordings**. It supports batch conversion, so feel free to add multiple files.
5. In the **Target File** section, you’ll see the default save location. By default, OBS sets the source folder as the destination folder. Click the **three-dots** (…) button to change the destination folder.  
![obs remux recording mkv to mp4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/obs-remux-recording-mkv-to-mp4.jpg)
6. Click **Remux** to proceed. OBS will start converting the video. This may take some time to complete, depending on the video size.
7. Once done, click **OK**.

 While OBS can quickly convert MKV files to MP4 format, it doesn’t offer any customization options. If you need more customization options, XMedia Recode and HandBrake are your best options.

**Download**: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/welcome) (Free)

## 4\. Convert MKV to MP4 Using VLC Media Player

 VLC is a free, open-source multimedia player that supports almost all audio and video formats, including MKV. If you have VLC installed, you don’t need to convert and play the video.

 However, if you still need to convert your MKV video, you can do so using the Convert feature in VLC. It's one of the [best-hidden features of VLC media player](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-top-secret-features-free-vlc-media-player-si/).

 To convert an MKV file to MP4 using the VLC media player, perform the following:

1. Open the VLC media player app on your PC.
2. In the VLC main window, click on **Media** and select **Convert/Save**. Alternatively, press the **Ctrl + R** key to access **Convert/Save**.  
![vlc media player convert save](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vlc-media-player-convert-save.jpg)
3. Next, click the **Add** button. Navigate and select the MKV video you want to convert.
4. Once the video is selected, click on **Convert/Save.**  
![open media vlc add source](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/open-media-vlc-add-source.jpg)
5. In the **Convert** dialog, click the drop-down for **Profile** and select **Video – H.264 + MP3 (MP4).**  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="	https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png" border="0">TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![conver vlc media player destination profile](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/conver-vlc-media-player-destination-profile.jpg)
6. Next, click the **Browse** button and select the file destination. You may need to enter a new name for the file to prevent the VLC media player from overwriting your original MKV file if it is in the same destination.
7. Once done, click **Start**.

 VLC media player timeline will show the conversion progress. Once it finishes, it will save your video to the destination folder.

 While VLC offers a handy video conversion feature, it can be painstakingly slow and even produce incomplete output with no audio or compromised video quality.

**Download**: [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/) (Free)

## 4\. HandBrake

 HandBrake is a free open-source video converter that supports almost all media formats. It is a multi-platform application available on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

 HandBrake is one of the easiest video converters you can use. For casual conversions, all you have to do is drag and drop the video onto the app, and it will automatically apply the most commonly used container settings. You can then select the destination folder and start encoding to convert the video.

 If you need more advanced options, HandBrake has them in abundance. You can change the subtitles, add chapter markers, perform the batch scan, use video filters, and more.

 Here’s how to use HandBrake to convert MKV to MP4:

1. Go to the [HandBrake page](https://handbrake.fr/) and download the installer. Run the setup file and install the app.
2. Next, go to the [Microsoft DotNET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and download **.NET 6.0 SDK x64**. Without this, HandBrake may not launch or work.
3. Next, open **HandBrake**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![HandBrake_convert mkv mp4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/HandBrake_convert-mkv-mp4jpg.jpg)
4. Click on **File** to and then select the MKV file to convert. You can also drag and drop the file onto the app to open the file.
5. In the **Summary** tab, make sure the **Format** is set to **MP4**. Here, we are using the default MP4 container settings applied by the app.
6. Next, click the **Browse** button and choose a location to save your new file.
7. You can rename the file if you want to and click **Save**.
8. On HandBrake’s main window, click on **Start Encode**. HandBrake will start encoding the video, so wait till the process is complete. The processing time depends on your file size and system capability.

 The only downside to using HandBrake is having to download an additional set of .NET tools from Microsoft. Otherwise, it is an excellent open-source video converter utility that can cater to both casual and power users. You can also use it to [compress and reduce video file size without losing quality](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reduce-video-file-size-without-sacrificing-quality/).

**Download**: [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

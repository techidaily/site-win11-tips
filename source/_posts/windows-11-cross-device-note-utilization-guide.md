 Sticky Notes is a great app for taking notes fast and jotting down important reminders. The best thing is, there is no download required—Sticky Notes comes pre-installed on all Windows 11 machines. To open Sticky Notes on Windows 11:

1. Click on the Windows Search bar or use the shortcut **Windows + Q**.
2. Search for “Sticky Notes”, then click on the app from the search results.

 Despite being a basic note-taking app, there are many features to stylize your notes. On the bottom formatting ribbon, you can format text using bold, italics, or strikethrough. There’s also an option to toggle bullets, perfect for making quick lists.

 Rather than offering a separate sticky notes app, Microsoft features Windows Sticky Notes as part of the Microsoft OneNote app. This [less-known feature of Microsoft OneNote](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-little-known-onenote-features-will-love/) is great for those who already have experience using OneNote, although, this trick can be easily learned by anyone.

 You can access Windows Sticky Notes on your iOS by following the steps below:

1. Go to the App Store and search for Microsoft OneNote.
2. After installation, sign in using your Microsoft account.
3. In the bottom right corner of the homepage, tap on **Sticky Notes**.

 To create a new note, hit the plus icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. You’ll then see a display similar to the Sticky Notes app for Windows, including its text formatting options. One helpful tool is the camera button, which allows you to upload a photo from your camera or iOS photo album.

 You can also view your sticky notes if you’re an Android user. Windows Sticky Notes is available in the Microsoft OneNote app for Android, although it is a little harder to find. Here’s how to access your sticky notes on Android devices:

1. Go to the Google Play Store and search for Microsoft OneNote.
2. Download and open the app, then sign in with your Microsoft account.

 On the homepage, you’ll see a mix of sticky notes and written notes from OneNote. To view sticky notes only, you’ll need to filter the results. Hit the **Sort & Filter** button on the left side of the top banner. Underneath the **Note Type** heading, select Sticky Notes and then select **Apply**. You can also sort sticky notes by created date, edited date, or alphabetically.

 To create a new sticky note, hit the three dots in the bottom right corner of the homepage. Then, tap **Create a Sticky Note**. The app includes many options featured on iOS, including the photo upload tool. You can change the note’s color by hitting the three dots in the top right corner. From the same menu, you can also tap the Export button to share sticky notes with your friends.

This polished launcher comes packed with features to boost your productivity and is a [must-have for Android users who own a PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-android-apps-for-windows/).

 Using Microsoft Launcher, you can view your sticky notes almost directly from the home screen. Simply swipe left from the home screen to access your feed.

Tick the box next to Sticky Notes to add the widget to your feed.

 As you're using a widget on a launcher, syncing may take a little longer than when using an app. However, you can sync your sticky notes manually at any point by hitting the three dots in the top right corner of the widget and selecting **Sync**.

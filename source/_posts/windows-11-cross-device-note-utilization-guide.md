2. Search for “Sticky Notes”, then click on the app from the search results.

 Rather than offering a separate sticky notes app, Microsoft features Windows Sticky Notes as part of the Microsoft OneNote app. This [less-known feature of Microsoft OneNote](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-little-known-onenote-features-will-love/) is great for those who already have experience using OneNote, although, this trick can be easily learned by anyone.

 You can access Windows Sticky Notes on your iOS by following the steps below:

1. Go to the App Store and search for Microsoft OneNote.
2. After installation, sign in using your Microsoft account.
3. In the bottom right corner of the homepage, tap on **Sticky Notes**.

 To create a new note, hit the plus icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. You’ll then see a display similar to the Sticky Notes app for Windows, including its text formatting options. One helpful tool is the camera button, which allows you to upload a photo from your camera or iOS photo album.

Hit the **Sort & Filter** button on the left side of the top banner. Underneath the **Note Type** heading, select Sticky Notes and then select **Apply**. You can also sort sticky notes by created date, edited date, or alphabetically.

 To create a new sticky note, hit the three dots in the bottom right corner of the homepage. Then, tap **Create a Sticky Note**. The app includes many options featured on iOS, including the photo upload tool. You can change the note’s color by hitting the three dots in the top right corner. From the same menu, you can also tap the Export button to share sticky notes with your friends.

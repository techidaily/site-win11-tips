3. Set the**Accent color** option to**Automatic** by clicking on the**Down Arrow** . The system will then automatically set an accent color based on the colors of the current wallpaper.
4. You can also have the same color theme on your Taskbar, Start Menu, Calendar pane, Notifications pane, and the Title Bars and Windows Borders. Just scroll down to the bottom of the**Colors** page and check the boxes next to**Show accent color on Start and taskbar** and**Show accent colors on title bars and windows borders** .

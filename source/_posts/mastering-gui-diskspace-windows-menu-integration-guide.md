## Mastering GUI Diskspace: Windows Menu Integration Guide

 Disk space analyzers are software packages that scan your PC’s storage drive and display visual reports. Such analyzers provide a visual overview of the biggest and smallest folders and files within directories in bytes and percentage terms. File Explorer doesn’t have any such graphical disk space analyzer for scanning specific folders.

 RidNacs are Disk Savvy are two disk space analyzer tools that integrate with File Explorer’s context menu. They enable you to analyze disk space by right-clicking folders and selecting their scanning options. This is how you can add and utilize those disk analyzers in Windows 11/10.

## How to Add a Visual Disk Space Analyzer Tool to Explorer’s Context Menu With RidNacs

 RidNacs is a freeware disk analyzer app with which you can scan whole drives, folders, or removable storage devices (USB sticks). This tool displays storage usage reports with percentage bars that give users a clear picture of what’s hogging the most space. You can add the RidNacs analyzer tool to Explorer’s context menu like this:

1. First, open this [RidNacs](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Hard-Disk-Utils/RidNacs.shtml) download page.
2. Click**Download Now** to view location options for downloading the software.
3. Select**Secure Download (US)** or**External mirror 1** depending on preference.
4. Press**Win + E** to open File Explorer ([see how to open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) for more methods) and double-click**RidNacs-2.03-Setup.exe** to open the app’s installer.
5. Select your preferred language for the software on the drop-down menu and click**OK** .
6. Click**Next** to view the license terms, and select the**I accept the agreement** option.
7. Keep clicking**Next** to reach additional task settings. There make sure the**Add RidNacs to Windows Explorer Context Menu** checkbox is selected.

8. Select**Next** again, and then press the**Install** button to proceed with the installation.

 Now you start analyzing folder storage space usage on your PC with RidNacs. Open the Explorer file manager window, and right-click a folder to select**Show more options** . Click the**Analyze Disk Space Usage with RidNacs** option on the classic context menu to start the scan.

 RidNacs will open and display drive storage usage for all subfolders and files within the directory, as shown in the snapshot directly below. The graphical bars there show you the percentage volume of all the subfolders and files within the selected directory. That window also shows the number of files in each subfolder along with standard size details.

 You can select other directories or a whole drive to scan within the RidNacs window. To do so, click**File** and the**Choose Directory** option. Then choose another folder or an entire drive to scan and click**OK** .

 RidNacs doesn’t have lots of customization settings. However, you can change the percentage bar style. To do so, click the**Preferences** button. Then select a different color option on the Percentage bar style. Select**Apply** \>**OK** to save the new bar style setting.

## How to Add a Visual Disk Space Analyzer Tool to Explorer’s Context Menu With Disk Savvy

 Disk Savvy is a slightly more advanced disk analyzer tool to RidNacs that includes a variety of pie and bar charts for users to view for analyzed folders. However, the freely available unregistered version’s file analysis is restricted to a maximum of 500,000 files. You’ll need to upgrade the software to its $50 pro version to remove that limitation. These are the steps for adding the Disk Savvy tool to File Explorer’s context menu.

1. Open the [Disk Savvy](https://www.disksavvy.com/downloads.html) download page.
2. Click the Win 64-Bit**Download** option for the Disk Savvy v14.7.26 product version.
3. Double-click**disksavvy\_setup\_v14.7.26\_x64.exe** .
4. Select**Next** and**I Agree** **to confirm acceptance** of the end user agreement.  
![The Disk Savvy setup wizard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/disk-savvy-window.jpg)
5. Then press**Install** to add the Disk Savvy tool to the Windows context menu.
6. Select**Next** when installation is complete.
7. Click**Finish** to exit the Disk Savvy setup window.

 Now you can try out the Disk Savvy analyzer utility. Go into File Explorer, and right-click a folder to analyze to select**Show more options** \>**Disk Savvy - Analyze Disk Space** . Click the**Analyze** button on the**Default Profil** e to confirm the selected directory.

 The Disk Savvy window that opens displays similar disk usage info to RidNacs. It includes columns that tell you how many files are in the subfolders, the byte size of each folder and file, and the percentage of their root directory’s total size they amount to. However, Disk Savvy also includes a**Categorize by** submenu that includes various options for viewing categorized file info.

 What sets Disk Savvy apart from RidNacs are its bar and pie graph options for viewing disk space usage info. Click the**Charts** button to access those options. Then you can select an option like**Disk Space Per File Type** ,**Disk Space Per Directory** , and**Disk Space Per Extension** to view a pie chart like the one below.

 Disk Savvy also has a feature that displays all the top (biggest) files within an analyzed folder. To utilize that feature, click the**Top Files** button. Then select an option like**View Top Images Sorted By File Size** or**View Top Music Files Sorted By the File Size** to see what the biggest ones are.

 This software can analyze multiple folders at once. To select multiple folders in the Disk Savvy window, click**Default profiles** on the left and the**+** **Add** **input** button for directories. Then select the**Add Input Directory** option, click the**ellipsis** button, choose a folder to add, and press the**OK** buttons. Click**Analyze** to scan all selected folders.

 You can save and export disk usage reports to various file formats. To do so, click the**Save** option. Select a file extension option on the**Report format** drop-down menu; click the**Report type** drop-down menu to choose an option there, and press the**Save** button.

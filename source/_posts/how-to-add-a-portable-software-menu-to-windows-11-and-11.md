## How to Add a Portable Software Menu to Windows 11 & 11

 Windows doesn’t incorporate any kind of menu for opening portable software. The Start menu doesn’t include portable apps because they aren’t installed software. So, users must usually utilize File Explorer to access and open portable apps on USB sticks.

 However, you can create a portable app menu for accessing programs on a USB stick (flash drive) with SyMenu and LiberKey. Those are freeware software packages designed to assist users with managing and accessing portable apps on USB drives. This is how you can set up a menu for portable software with SyMenu and LiberKey.

## How to Add a Portable Software Menu With SyMenu

 SyMenu is a portable app menu to which you can add software, document file, website URL, folder, and command shortcuts. It adds a menu for portable software you can access on the desktop or by clicking its system tray icon in Windows. You can add a portable software menu to Windows 11 and 10 with SyMenu like this:

1. First, insert a USB flash drive into your PC.
2. Open the[SyMenu](https://www.ugmfree.it/SyMenuDownload.aspx) download page.
3. Click the**exe package** option.

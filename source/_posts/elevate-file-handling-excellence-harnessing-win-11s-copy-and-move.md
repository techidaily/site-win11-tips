## Elevate File Handling Excellence: Harnessing Win 11’S Copy & Move

 macOS has a native "New Folder with Selection" context menu option which automatically bundles all selected files into a new folder. It's a convenient two-in-one option for creating a folder and moving selected files into it. It’s a pity Windows 11 doesn’t have a similar context menu option.

 However, you can add this feature to Windows 11’s context menu with Files 2 Folder and TeraCopy. Both software packages add context menu options for putting selected files into new folders. This is how you can put selected files into new folders in Windows 11\.

## How to Place Selected Files Into a New Folder With Files 2 Folder

 Files 2 Folder is little more than a shell extension that adds a new option to Windows 11’s classic context menu. Selecting **Files 2 Folder** on the context menu brings up a window with four options for moving the selected files into a new directory.

 You can place selected files into a new folder with Files 2 Folder as follows:

1. Open the [Files 2 Folder webpage](https://www.dcmembers.com/skwire/download/files-2-folder/) in your web browser and download it.
2. Double-click the **Files2Folder.exe** file.
3. Select **Yes** to register the shell extension.

4. Now bring up a directory that includes some files with which to create a new folder.
5. Select files to include in your new folder.
6. Then right-click a selected file and select **Show more options** and **Files 2 Folder** on the classic context menu.

7. Input a folder name within the text for the **Move all selected items into a subfolder named** option.

8. Click **OK** to create the new folder with the files selected moved into it. The new folder will be in the directory where you selected the files.

 You can also select one of three alternative folder creation options within the Files 2 Folder window. The **Move each file to individual subfolders based on their names** option does what its label says. Or create a dated directory by selecting **Move all selected files to a date folder**.

 If you need to organize selected files according to format, select **Move each file to subfolders based on their file extensions**.

## How to Place Selected Files Into a New Folder With TeraCopy

 TeraCopy is freeware software for Windows 11, 10, 8, and 7 that enables users to set up and automate move and copy file operations. Once you integrate TeraCopy with Explorer’s context menu, it will add a **New folder with selection** option you can click to quickly put the selected files into a new folder.

 Here is how you can place a selection of files into a new folder with TeraCopy:

1. Open this [TeraCopy download page](https://codesector.com/downloads) and download it.
2. Select **teracopy.exe** to start the setup wizard.
3. Go through the installer, and at the end, click **Finish** with **Launch TeraCopy** selected.
4. Next, click the **Settings** cog icon in TeraCopy.  
![The Teracopy window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/teracopy-window.jpg)
5. Make sure the **Add to Explorer context menu** option is selected.
6. Click **OK** to exit the preferences and close the TeraCopy window.  
![The Add to Explorer context menu option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/add-to-explorer-context-menu.jpg)

 Now that TeraCopy is ready to go, let's put it to use.

1. Hold down **CTRL** and click the files you want to put into a folder.
2. Right-click to select **Show more options** and the **New folder with selection** option.  
![The New folder with selection option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/new-folder-with-selection-option.jpg)
3. Then input a title for your new folder and press **Enter**.
4. The new folder is created as a subfolder within the directory that included your original file selection. Open the new folder to view and access the files you selected to move into it.

 TeraCopy also provides us with another way to move more files into your new folder. To do so, select **Menu** \> **Add files** in the TeraCopy window. Select the files you want to move and click **Open**. Then click **Move** \> **Browse** to choose the directory and press the **Select Folder** button.

## Add a Handy New Folder Creation Option to Windows 11’s Context Menu

 macOS' folder creation option is a lifesaver, and it's a shame Windows doesn't have it by default. We can only be grateful for TeraCopy and Files 2 Folders enabling us to utilize the same feature on Windows 11, and we can only hope Windows 12 adds it by default.

 However, you can add this feature to Windows 11’s context menu with Files 2 Folder and TeraCopy. Both software packages add context menu options for putting selected files into new folders. This is how you can put selected files into new folders in Windows 11\.

## Tackling the Format Rejection by Windows-VLC

 It is not often that VLC Media Player fails to play a file. But sometimes, when you try to open a media file, you may encounter the "your input can’t be opened" error on VLC. This error can occur with both local media files and when you try to stream a YouTube video, albeit for different reasons.

 Invalid file or folder name, issues with the VLC media player, and issues with YouTube.luac file are the common causes of this error. If you experience this error, here are a few quick fixes to resolve the "your input can’t be opened" VLC error on Windows.

 If the error occurs when streaming a YouTube video, skip to the fourth solution in this guide.

## 1\. Change the File/Folder Path

![copy folder file move windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/copy-folder-file-move-windows-11.jpg)

 The "your input can’t be opened" error can occur if the folder path for the saved media is too long. For example, if your file is saved in D:\\Users\\Downloads\\Media\\New\\Files, moving it to a main folder such as**D:\\Users** can fix the issue.

To move the media file to a different folder:

1. Press**Win + E** to open**File Explorer** .
2. Next, navigate to the folder where your media files are saved.
3. Right-click on the media file and select**Copy** .
4. Next, create a new folder in**D:\\Users** and paste the file. Now open the file to see if it plays without the error.

## 2\. Change Folder or File Name

![rename file folder windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rename-file-folder-windows-11.jpg)

 If you have a large folder with hundreds of media files,[renaming the folder or file on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-rename-files/) can help you fix this error. Try to rename the folder with a short name to fix the error.

 That said, if the issue is with individual files, try to rename the video file to something simple without using any special characters. Even if the original file name has no visible special characters, rename it with a random name and then try to play the media.

To rename the folder:

1. Press**Win + E** to open**File Explorer** .
2. Next, navigate to the folder which has your media files with errors.
3. Select and right-click on the folder.
4. Select the**Rename** option from the context menu. Alternatively, press**F2** on your keyboard to access the rename option.
5. Rename the folder or file to a small name than the current folder name. Avoid using any special characters.
6. Once renamed, open the folder and play any media file with the error to see if the problem is resolved.

## 3\. Reset VLC Media Player Preference

 VLC offers tons of customization options. If the error is triggered after making a change to the VLC media player, you can reset the preferences to fix the issue.

 Note that when you reset preferences, you will lose all the changes made to your VLC media player. To reset VLC's preferences:

1. Launch the**VLC Media Player** and click on**Tools** .
2. Select**Preferences** from the context menu. Alternatively, press**Ctrl + P** to open the Simple Preferences dialog.

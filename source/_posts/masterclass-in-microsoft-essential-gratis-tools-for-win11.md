## Masterclass in Microsoft: Essential Gratis Tools for Win11

 Windows 11 comes with plenty of new features, thus reducing the dependency on third-party apps for minor tweaks. However, like any other operating system, third-party apps help extend the OS's functionality to a great extent.

 For example, Windows 11 has a built-in ZIP file extractor, but a third-party app like 7-Zip provides advanced file compression features. Similarly, Adobe Express and Lightroom offer advanced image and video editing features compared to the built-in Video Editor and Photos app.

 Here we have collected a list of free tools for Windows 11 that average and advanced users will benefit from in their day-to-day tasks.

## 1\. QuickLook
![quick look windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/quick-look-windows-11.jpg)

 Windows 11 lets you view the large thumbnail of images in File Explorer. However, it still lacks a preview feature if you want a glance at your files without opening them in the Photos app.

 QuickLook can fix this problem. It is a third-party utility on Microsoft Store that lets you view the preview of images, icons, and documents such as PDFs with the help of the spacebar.

 To view a preview, highlight an image and then press the spacebar. Press again to close the preview. The preview dialog offers more options to pin the preview, open the image in a different app and keep the preview on top.

 Windows 11 comes with a rudimentary archive file extraction feature. However, if you need wide support for various file formats, 7-Zip is an excellent alternative. It is an open-source file compression utility and is easy to use.

 Additional features include AES-256 encryption support, a command line version, and multi-language support. It also acts like a file manager where you can move and copy files and even delete them from the app's interface.

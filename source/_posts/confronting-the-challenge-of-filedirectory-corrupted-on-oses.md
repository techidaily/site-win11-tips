 Another possible factor for error 0x80070570 occurring is your PC’s antivirus shield is hindering the file operation.

 If you don’t have third-party security software, turn off Windows Security’s real-time antivirus shield, as covered in our article about [disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/permanently-disable-microsoft-defender-windows-11/). .

## Addressing WSL Registration Failure - Error X80370102 Fix Guide

 The 0x80370102 error occurs when the users attempt to install and run a Linux distribution using the 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' feature. In several cases, the error is caused when the users try to install both Linux and Debian distros and is typically related to problems with the hardware Virtualization feature in BIOS.

 Below, we take a look at the causes of this issue and the troubleshooting methods that will help you resolve the problem in no time.

## What Causes the Error 0x80370102 in Windows?

 The error at hand can be caused by a number of reasons, especially hardware issues. Here is a list of the most common reasons behind this issue:

* Hyper-V and other relevant settings are disabled - Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product, lets you create and run the virtual machine. This service and other relevant services like the Virtualization setting should be enabled from the BIOS for you to be able to install and run distros.
* You are using Windows Insider Preview build - If you are not using a completely developed version of Windows, you are also likely to run into errors like the one at hand.
* The Lxssmanager.exe service is corrupt - the Lxssmanager.exe service manages the launch of new WSL instances. If this service is corrupt or just not working properly, you will not be able to install a Linux distribution to access via Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.

 Now that we know about the causes of this problem letâ€™s have a look at the solutions that will hopefully fix the problem for good. However, before we proceed, we recommend that you [double-check if your computer supports hardware virtualization](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/virtualization-issues-simple-solutions/) .

 In case you are using an Insider Build of Windows, consider installing a stable Windows version, since a version under development is prone to errors like this one.

## 1\. Enable Hyper-V

 The first thing that we recommend doing is making sure that all the relevant services like Hyper-V and Virtualization are enabled. In this method, we will be enabling the Hyper-V feature using the Control Panel. We will also use the Task Manager utility to check if the Virtualization feature is working fine.

Here is how you can enable Hyper-V on your PC:

1. Press the**Win + R** keys together to open a Run dialog.
2. Choose the**Programs** option and then click on**Program and Features** .  
![Choose Programs and Features in the Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/program-and-features.jpg)
3. Click on**Turn Windows Feature on or off** in the left pane.  
![Turn Windows features on or off option in Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/turn-windows-features-on-or-off.jpg)
4. In the following dialog, checkmark the box associated with**Hyper-V** and click**OK** .  
![Enable Hyper-V in the Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hyper-v-setting.jpg)
5. Once done, restart your computer and check if the issue is resolved. While you are at it, we also recommend checking if the Virtual Machine Platform feature is enabled by following the same steps. If it is disabled, enabling it should help you fix the issue as well.

 Next, we will check if Virtualization is enabled on the device. In most devices, it is disabled by default. Follow the steps below to proceed:

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys together to open Task Manager,
2. Click on the**More details** button to expand the Task Manager window.

![More details option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/task-manager-more-details.jpg)
3. Head over to the**Performance** tab and click on CPU.
4. Under the CPU graph on the right side, check the status for**Virtualization** . In case you are not sure if your PC supports virtualization, view the Hyper-V support section in the same window. If it says Yes, then it implies that you can make use of hardware virtualization on your computer.

5. Alternatively, open Run by pressing the**Win + R** keys together.
6. Type cmd in the text field and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to open Command Prompt as admin.
7. Click**Yes** in the User Account Control Prompt.
8. Type systeminfo in Command Prompt and hit Enter.
9. Wait for the command to execute, and then head over to the**Hyper-V requirements** section. You should be able to see if the Virtualization is enabled from there.

![Check Hyper-V requirements in Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hyper-v-requirements.jpg)

 If the service is disabled,[enabling the Hyper-V technology on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-enable-hyper-v/) should fix the problem for you.

## 2\. Restart the LxssManager Service

 As we mentioned earlier, the LxssManager service should be working properly for you to install the Linux distribution and run it.

 If a service is acting up, the easiest way to fix it is by restarting it. In this method, we will use the Windows Services utility to make these changes.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Press the**Win + R** keys together to open a Run dialog.
2. Type services.msc in Run and click**OK** .
3. In the following window, look for the**LxssManager** service and right-click on it.
4. Choose**Properties** from the context menu.  
![LxssManager service properties](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lxssmanager-utility.jpg)
5. Now, click on the**Stop** button, wait for a few seconds, and then hit**Start** .  
![Click on the Start button in the Properties dialog](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/stop-button.jpg)
6. Once the service is restarted, check if the issue is resolved.

## 3\. Enable Nested Virtualization and Change the RAM Settings

 Another fix that worked for users was enabling Nested virtualization, a feature that enables you to run Hyper-V inside a Hyper-V virtual machine. If this feature is disabled on your computer, enabling it will hopefully resolve the problem for you.

Here is how you can proceed:

1. Type Powershell in Windows search and click on**Run as administrator** .
2. Click**Yes** in the User Account Control prompt.
3. Type the following command in the Powershell window and click Enter to execute it.  
Set-VMProcessor <VMName> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true

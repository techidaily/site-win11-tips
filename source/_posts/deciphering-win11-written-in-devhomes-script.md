## Deciphering Win11' Written in DevHome's Script

 If you're a developer exhausted from setting up software dependencies and dealing with multiple tools, you're in luck. Microsoft has developed Dev Home, a specialized platform for Windows 11 developers that improves productivity and lets you work more efficiently.

 Read on as we dive into what Dev Home is and how it can significantly boost your productivity.

## What Is Dev Home for Windows 11?

 It’s no secret that developers have complex workflows involving intricate project setups. This includes constantly switching between different apps, navigating to the relevant file system directories, and using multiple sign-in identities to get the job done.

 Microsoft introduced Dev Home to simplify developer workflow and allow developers to focus on what matters. The Redmond giant first announced this feature on the [Windows Developer Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/) in May 2023\.

 The Dev Home control center lets users quickly set up a customized dev environment, install relevant packages, easily [clone repos from GitHub](https://www.makeuseof.com/clone-github-repository-git-bash/), monitor projects from a personalized dashboard, and even create a dedicated file system–the Dev Drive.

 Although Linux is a popular choice among developers, the latest enhancements in Windows, such as the improved WSL 2 and the introduction of Dev Home, could potentially make Windows 11 a more appealing option for development.

## How to Get Dev Home on Windows 11

 Microsoft has made Dev Home available as a preview in Windows 11\. If your PC is on Windows 11, you can get it for free through the Microsoft Store. To download Dev Home on Windows 11:

1. Launch the **Start** menu, search for **Microsoft Store,** and select the Best match.

### The Dev Drive File System

 Dev Drive is a dedicated storage volume made for developers. It provides improved performance and security to help effortlessly manage multiple directories that often consist of hundreds of files.

 Microsoft discusses the effectiveness of this system on the [Windows Developer Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/):

> Dev Drive is based on the Resilient File System, which, combined with a new performance mode capability in Microsoft Defender for Antivirus, offers up to 30% file system improvement in build times for file I/O scenarios. The new performance mode is more secure for your workloads than folder or process exclusions, providing an ultimate solution to balance security with performance.

## Uncover the Secrets to Flawless Subtitle Display on Windows 11

 Subtitles can be a lifesaver, especially when watching a movie in an unfamiliar language. However, if your Prime Video subtitles aren't working, you'll miss out on important dialogues or plot points. Fortunately, there are various fixes for this problem.

 In this article, we'll share five things to try when Prime Video subtitles are not working in Windows 11\. So, let's begin.

## 1\. Perform Some Basic Fixes

 While most of the content on Prime Video has subtitles, there are exceptions as well. It's possible that subtitles are unavailable for the movie or show you are streaming. To check for that possibility, play the title, click the**Subtitles and Audio** icon at the top, and check if subtitles are available.

 The issue can also appear as a temporary glitch. In this case, you can turn subtitles off and back on to fix the issue. Here's a step-by-step instructions to do that:

1. Play the title on Prime Video and click**Subtitles and Audio** icon at the top.
2. Choose the**Off** option.

3. Wait for a few seconds. Then, turn on the subtitles of your preferred language.

 Another quick way to fix Prime Video subtitles not working is to sign out and then back into your Prime Video account. To do that, click on your account name in the bottom left corner, and choose**Sign out** from the context menu.

## 2\. Eliminate Browser Issues

 If you access Prime Video via the web, your browser's corrupt cache data is probably causing the problem. You'll have to manually[clear your browser's cache data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) to fix the issue.

 Browser extensions usually help to increase productivity. But some extensions can do more harm than good. So,[disable all browser extensions](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/) from your browser and see if that fixes the subtitles not working in Prime Video.

 The problem can also occur due to an issue in the current version of your browser. In this case, you can[update your browser](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-chrome-firefox-edge-desktop-mobile/) to fix the issue.

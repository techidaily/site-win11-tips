## Directives for Managing Setup Service State in Windows

 Are you looking for a way to disable the Windows Installer Service on your device? This essential component of your operating system performs all necessary installation processes, but can sometimes interfere with other programs.

 Fortunately, there are three ways in which it can be disabled—using the Windows Service tool, Group Policy Editor, or Registry Editor. Check out our guide below to learn how.

## 1\. Use Windows Services

 To begin, press**Win + R** on your keyboard to launch the Run dialog box. In the text box, type**services.msc** , and hit enter. This will open the Services window.

 If you ever need to re-enable the service, follow the same procedure and click**Start** in the Service status section.

## 2\. Use Local Group Policy Editor

 You can also use the group policy editor to enable or disable the Windows Installer service on your Windows computer system. However, it is important to note that this tool only works on Windows Pro and Enterprise editions. Therefore, if you are using Windows Home Edition, you must first [activate the Local Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) .

 Registry Editor is another method you can use to enable or disable the Windows Installer service on any version of Windows, even Home Edition.

4. In the right panel, double-click on**Start** and change its value from**2** to**4** .

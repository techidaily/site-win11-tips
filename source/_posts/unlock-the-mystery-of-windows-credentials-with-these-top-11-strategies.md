## Unlock the Mystery of Windows Credentials with These Top 11 Strategies

 Credential Manager in Windows 11 stores all the username and password combinations that you use for websites you visit in Edge browsers, apps, or networks. Microsoft introduced Credential Manager with Windows 10 and since then it stores and manages all credentials in one place. You can even back up and remove credential entries that are obsolete.

 The most obvious method to access the Credential Manager is using the Control Panel. But do you know that there are other methods to access this password management too? We will list out all the possible ways to open it quickly. Let’s begin.

3. Credential Manager will open in a separate control panel window.

## 4\. Using the File Explorer

 Credential Manager’s DLL file is located inside the SysWoW64 folder. You can access it using File Explorer and then run it using Control Panel. Ensure that you have administrator privileges to access the SysWOW64 folder before trying this method. Here’s how:

1. Press**Win + E** to[launch the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) .
2. Go to the address bar, paste the following path, and press the**Enter** key:**C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64**
3. Once you are inside the SysWOW64 folder, locate the**keymgr.dll file** and right-click on it.
4. Select**Show more options** from the context menu and then click on the**Open with** option.
5. Scroll down and click on the**Choose an app on your PC** option.
6. Navigate to the C drive and click on the Windows folder. Then, open the SysWOW64 folder.
7. Find the**Control.exe** program and select it. Click on the**Open** button.

## 5\. Using the CMD

 You can use the Command Prompt to open Credential Manager directly. No need to navigate through Control Panel to locate the utility. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to launch Command Prompt with administrator privileges.
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press the**Enter** key:**control.exe keymgr.dll**  
![Open Credentials Manager Using the CMD](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-the-cmd.jpg)
4. Credentials Manager will launch on your system. Close the Command Prompt window.

## 6\. Using Control Panel

 Control Panel is the central hub for many system utilities and also contains Credential Manager. If you prefer the GUI method to open any Windows utility, you can use Control Panel. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press**Win + R** to launch the Run command box. Type**control** and press the**Enter** key.
2. In the Control Panel window, click on the**User Accounts** option.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-control-panel.jpg)
3. Lastly, click on the**Credential Manager** option to launch the tool.

## 7\. Using a Desktop Shortcut

 A desktop shortcut can save much time in Credential Manager on the system. Since it is not an executable program but a DLL file, merely making a desktop shortcut won’t work. Instead, we will create a shortcut of the Credential Manager DLL file and configure it to open with Control Panel.

 Repeat the following steps to create a shortcut for Credential Manager:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to Desktop.
2. Right-click on the Desktop and select the**New > Shortcut** option from the context menu.
3. In the Create Shortcut window, paste the following text in the Location box:**control.exe /name Microsoft.CredentialManager**  
![Open Credentials Manager Using a Desktop Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-desktop-shortcut.jpg)
4. Click on the**Next** button. Name the shortcut**Credential Manager** and click on the**Finish** button.

5. Now, double-click on the shortcut to open Credential Manager.

## 8\. Using the Settings App

 Microsoft hasn’t moved all Control Panel options to the Settings app. But it is possible to search and access Credential Manager inside the Settings app. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Right-click** on the Start button to open the Power User menu. Select the**Settings** option from the menu.
2. Navigate to the top-left corner and click on the**Find a setting** option.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using the Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-the-settings-app.jpg)
3. Type**Credential Manager** and click on the first relevant search result for the utility.

## 10\. Using a Batch File

 A batch file is a more convenient method to open Credential Manager whenever you need it. You can place it on the desktop and run it with administrator privileges just like a shortcut. Repeat the following steps to create a batch file:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to the Desktop. Right-click on the desktop and select the**New > Text Document** option.
2. Open the empty text document and paste the following code snippet:  
`@echo off powershell.exe control.exe keymgr.dll`
3. Press**Ctrl + Shift + S** to open the**Save as** window. Name the file “**CredMgr.bat** ” and click on the**Save** button.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using a Batch File](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-batch-file.jpg)
4. Close the Notepad file. Navigate to the location where you saved the CredMgr.bat file.

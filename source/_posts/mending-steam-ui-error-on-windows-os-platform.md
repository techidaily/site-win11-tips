## Mending Steam UI Error on Windows OS Platform

 While accessing Steam is usually a matter of double-clicking the app shortcut on your desktop or selecting it from the Start menu, there can be instances when you run into issues. At times, Steam may fail to open on Windows and display the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error instead.

 If this has happened to you, don’t panic. Here are some effective ways to resolve the annoying error message.

## Bypass the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” Error in Steam With a Quick Workaround

 If you need to access Steam quickly and don’t have time to figure out what’s causing the error, it's possible to bypass Steam’s “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error with a workaround. Simply open Steam and wait for the error message to appear. This time, instead of closing the error message, double-click Steam's shortcut to open it again.

 Of course, this is just a temporary fix. If you are looking to resolve the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error for good, employ the following solutions.

## 1\. Restart the Steam Client

 At times, Steam may encounter issues while launching and fail to load its graphical user interface (GUI) on Windows. As Steam is already running in the background, repeated attempts to open the app may prove fruitless and result in the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error. To fix this, you can try closing the Steam client completely [using the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-windows-task-manager/) and reopening it.

 Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager. In the **Processes** tab, right-click on **Steam** and select the **End task** option from the context menu. Try launching Steam again and see if it works.

## 2\. Delete the SteamUI.dll and libswscale-x.dll Files

 If restarting the Steam client does not help, it’s likely that the SteamUI.dll and the libswscale-x.dll files on your system have become corrupted. If that's the case, you will need to remove these files manually. Doing so will force Steam to download fresh copies of these DLL files the next time you open it.

1. Right-click on the **Steam** shortcut on your desktop and select **Properties**.
2. Under the **Shortcut** tab, click the **Open File Location** button.
3. In the File Explorer window that opens, locate and select the **SteamUI.dll** and **libswscale-x.dll** files.
4. Click the **trash icon** at the top to delete them.

 Reopen Steam after this and see if you get any errors.

## 3\. Delete the Beta File From Steam Directory

 Are you using the beta version of the Steam client? If so, you are likely to experience such errors while using Steam on Windows.

 Since you can not open Steam, you won’t be able to leave the beta program via the in-app settings menu. Fortunately, there’s another way to exit Steam’s beta program and switch to the stable version of the app. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press **Win + E** to [open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. Navigate to the directory where you have installed Steam.
3. Double-click the **package** folder to open it.
4. Locate the **Beta** file within the folder and delete it.  
![Delete Steam Beta File on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/delete-steam-beta-file-on-windows.jpg)

 Restart your PC after this and try to open Steam again. It should download the necessary files to switch to the stable version of the app, and the “Failed to Load steamui.dll” error should not appear.

## 4\. Clear Steam Download Cache

 Corrupt or inaccessible download caches can also affect Steam’s performance on Windows and lead to such errors. You can try clearing Steam’s download cache to see if that helps. Here's how to do it.

1. Open Steam on your PC.
2. Click the **Steam** menu in the top left corner and select **Settings**.
3. Select **Downloads** from the left sidebar.
4. Click the **Clear Download Cache** button on your right.

## 5\. Reset Steam Configuration Settings

 Resetting the configuration settings of Steam is an effective way to fix all kinds of issues with the Steam client, including the one discussed here. So, if clearing Steam’s download cache proves ineffective, use these steps to reset Steam's configuration settings:

1. Click the **Show hidden icons** menu on the taskbar.
2. Right-click on the **Steam** logo and select **Exit Steam**.
3. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
4. Type **steam://flushconfig** in the box and press **Enter**.
5. Click **OK** to confirm.

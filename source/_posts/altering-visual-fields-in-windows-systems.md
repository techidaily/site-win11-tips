## Altering Visual Fields in Windows Systems

 While the default landscape orientation on your Windows computer is suitable for most tasks, there can be times when you need to change it. Whether it's for work, creative endeavors, or simply personal preference, rotating the display on your Windows computer is quick and easy.

 Here, we share three methods for changing the display orientation on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Change Windows Display Orientation via the Settings App

 The Display section in the Windows Settings app makes it easy for you to [modify things like screen brightness](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-adjust-screen-brightness/), color, layout, scale, and more. Additionally, it also offers the option to change the display orientation on your Windows 10 or 11 computer.

 Use the following steps:

1. Press **Win + I** or use one of [the many ways to open the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Head over to **System > Display**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Display orientation** to select from the available options: **Landscape**, **Portrait**, **Landscape (flipped)**, and **Portrait (flipped)**.
4. Click the **Keep changes** button to confirm.

 Once you have completed the above steps, Windows will rotate your screen 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees, depending on the option you select.

## 2\. Change Windows Display Orientation via the Graphics Control Panel

 Apart from the system settings, you can also use the built-in graphics control panel to change the display orientation on Windows. However, the exact steps for doing so will depend on the type of [graphics card installed on your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-graphics-card-model-windows-11/).

 Here's how you can rotate your screen using the Intel Graphics Command Center and the NVIDIA Control Panel.

## 3\. Change Windows Display Orientation With Keyboard Shortcuts

 Another quick way to rotate your Windows computer's screen is to use keyboard shortcuts. This method can be especially useful if you frequently need to switch between different display orientations.

 Here are the keyboard shortcuts you can use to rotate your computer screen.

* **Ctrl + Alt + Right arrow:** Rotates your screen clockwise by 90 degrees (portrait-flipped).
* **Ctrl + Alt + Left arrow:** Rotates your screen counterclockwise by 90 degrees (portrait).
* **Ctrl + Alt + Down arrow:** Rotates your screen 180 degrees (landscape-flipped).
* **Ctrl + Alt + Up arrow:** Resets your screen to its original orientation (landscape).

 It's important to note that the above keyboard shortcuts may not work on all Windows computers. If they do not work on your PC, you can use the Settings app or the built-in Graphics Control Panel to make the necessary adjustments.

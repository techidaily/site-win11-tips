 With Microsoft Excel's

        `UPPER`
    
 , `LOWER` , and `PROPER` functions, you can capitalize your text as well as turn your text to lowercase or proper case. You can specify your text as a [cell reference](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-step-by-step-guide-to-kinemasters-green-screen-mastery-for-2024/) or directly in the function. We'll show you how.

##  Capitalize Text Using the UPPER Function

 If you'd like to turn all letters of [the text you've added](https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-review-top-long-reach-routers-dominating-the-market-in-ebytes/) to uppercase (i.e., capitalize your text), specify your text in Excel's

        `UPPER`
    
 function as follows.

 First, in your spreadsheet, select the cell in which you want to display the uppercase text.

![Select a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1-excel-uppercase-select-cell.png) 

 In the selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. In the function, make sure to replace `B3` with the cell that contains the text you want to capitalize.

=UPPER(B3)

![Enter the UPPER function.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2-excel-uppercase-function.png) 

 If you don't have your text in a cell, specify the text directly in the function as follows. In this function, replace `My Text` with the text you want to turn to uppercase.

=UPPER("My Text")

 Excel will display the resulting uppercase text in your selected cell.

 To [make all the letters of your text lowercase](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/oppo-tutorial-bypass-lock-screensecurity-password-pinfingerprintpattern-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/), utilize Excel's `LOWER` function as follows.

##  Turn Text to Proper Case Using the PROPER Function

 Proper case capitalizes the first letter of each word in your text. If you'd like to use this text formatting, make use of the `PROPER` function as follows.

 First, in your spreadsheet, choose the cell where you want to display the result.

![Click a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7-excel-proper-case-click-cell.png) 

 In the chosen cell, enter the following function and press Enter. Here, replace `B3` with the cell that has the text you want to turn to proper case.

=PROPER(B3)

![Type the PROPER function.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/8-excel-proper-case-function.png) 

 If you'd like to use the text directly in the function, use the function below. Here, you'll replace `our text` with your own text.

=PROPER("our text")

 Excel will apply the proper case formatting and display the result in your chosen cell.

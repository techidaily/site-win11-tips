2. Enter **Control Panel** into Run and select **OK**.

## 2\. Clear the Microsoft Store’s Cache

 Some Microsoft Store users who’ve needed to fix error 0x80073CF3 have confirmed running the "wsreset" command can work. Wsreset is a command specifically for clearing (or resetting) the Microsoft Store’s cached data. Our article about [resetting the Microsoft Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-reset-microsoft-store/) tells you how to execute this handy command in Windows 10 and 11\.

## 3\. Reset the Microsoft Store App

 Windows Settings also includes a **Reset** option for the Microsoft Store. Selecting **Reset** is a similar fix to running the wsreset command, but it’s a more general option for clearing all Microsoft Store’s data. As such, if the wsreset command is ineffective, try performing a reset instead. You can apply this solution by following the instructions within our guide on [how to reset apps in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/).

## 5\. Turn Off Any Active Antivirus Apps

 Antivirus apps can sometimes interfere with the downloading and installing of legitimate apps. This can happen when an antivirus utility wrongly flags an app.

Then select to download/install the Microsoft Store apps for which error 0x80073CF3 occurs with the antivirus software deactivated.

 Windows also has a pre-installed antivirus tool. If you don’t have third-party antivirus software, you can try disabling the Microsoft Defender antivirus component.

 Ava Accessibility captions live conversations to provide accessibility to hearing-impaired people. Combined with simple and user-friendly features and intuitive interface, this Special Recognition winner will enable you or your hearing-impaired loved ones to work, learn, connect, and enjoy on Windows.

 If you've edited videos earlier, it was probably with timeline editors where you drag and drop audio and video clips to a timeline. Descript is a path-breaking app that changes the way you edit videos. It simplifies video editing by automatically transcribing recordings so you can easily edit them just like editing a Word doc.

 Just upload your videos to instantly transcribe them. Then, make changes to the text to directly edit your media clips. It's like you have the script of the video before you, split up into clips of the scenes. This way, you can edit the script and then check the clips to review the changes.

 This ability to streamline complex, multi-track A/V editing in a novel and accessible way made Descript the winning Creativity choice of Microsoft editors. You can even record your screen and webcam directly in Descript and convert those recordings into text. Descript transcriptions are fast and accurate, and the app includes automatic speaker detection.

 Moreover, Descript has AI-powered features like Overdub, a personalized text-to-speech voice synthesis for minor recording fixes. Thanks to AI, you can also automatically edit out filler words like uhhs and umms and silence gaps with a single click.

 With Descript, you have a powerful tool to create outstanding video recordings, whether it's a pitch to a client, a podcast, or the next viral video sensation.

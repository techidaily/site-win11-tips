## Solutions for Non-Installing Java in Windows Environment

### Key Takeaways

* Use the Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter from Microsoft's website to fix Java installation issues on your Windows 10 or 11 PC.
* Try installing Java with the offline installer for a more reliable installation process.
* Run the Java installer file with administrator rights to ensure full system access.

 There are many old Java-based Windows software packages for which users still need to install Java on their PCs to run. However, some users can’t install the desktop Java software when needed because of installation issues. Or users can’t update Java when such issues arise.

 Java installation errors have variable messages, but they all mean Java failed to install. Some reported error messages say, “Unable to install Java” or “Java install did not complete.” This is how you can fix Java installation errors on your Windows 10 or 11 PC.

## 1\. Run the Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter

 Some users have said the Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter for Windows helped them fix their Java installation issues. That’s not a troubleshooter included with Windows, but you can download it from Microsoft’s website. You can run the Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter like this:

1. Select **Download troubleshooter** on the [Microsoft website page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d).

## 2\. Try Installing Java With the Offline Installer

 If the Java installation error arises with the online installer or with automatic updates enabled, try utilizing the alternative offline Java installer. The offline Java installer is often more reliable than the buggy online one for which a stable internet connection is required.

![The Windows Offline download link](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/windows-offline-download-link.jpg)

 You can obtain that installation package by clicking the **Windows Offline (64-bit)** link on the [Java download page](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). If you have a 32-bit Windows 10 platform, click the **Windows Offline** package link. Double-click the downloaded Java installation file to run the installer and select the **Install** option from there.

## 5\. Repair Windows' System Files

 System file corruption isn’t widely confirmed to cause any specific Java installation error. However, don’t rule out the possibility of corrupted system files causing installation issues on your PC. You can easily [repair corrupted Windows files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) by running System File Checker and Deployment Image Servicing and Management scans with these Command Prompt commands:

`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth  
  
sfc /scannow`

## 6\. Turn Off Antivirus Shields and Firewalls

 Disabling antivirus protection is another resolution users confirm to have fixed Java installation issues with. Doing so will ensure a real-time antivirus shield can’t block the installation of Java. So, try temporarily off the antivirus shield for any third-party security software on your PC before attempting to install Java. Right-click the security app’s icon in the system tray to select an option for disabling it.

![Temporarily disable antivirus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/disable-antivirus.jpg)

 A firewall can also feasibly cause issues for the online Java installer at least. So, temporarily disable Microsoft Defender Firewall or a third-party alternative installed before running the Java installer to eliminate that potential cause. Our [how to turn off Microsoft Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-microsoft-defender-firewall/) guide includes instructions for disabling that firewall.

## 7\. Reboot Windows With a Clean Boot

 A clean boot is a stripped-down Windows startup that excludes third-party apps and services. Setting a clean boot stops third-party apps and services automatically starting with Windows. Applying this resolution can potentially fix some Java installation errors because it prevents third-party background apps or services from conflicting with the Java installation process.

 Our guide on [performing a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) tells you how to disable third-party startup items. When you’ve done that, have another go at installing Java after rebooting Windows 11/10\. Then you can re-enable all the disabled startup items via Task Manager and MSConfig.

## 2\. Try Installing Java With the Offline Installer

 If the Java installation error arises with the online installer or with automatic updates enabled, try utilizing the alternative offline Java installer. The offline Java installer is often more reliable than the buggy online one for which a stable internet connection is required.

If you have a 32-bit Windows 10 platform, click the **Windows Offline** package link. Double-click the downloaded Java installation file to run the installer and select the **Install** option from there.

## 5\. Repair Windows' System Files

 System file corruption isn’t widely confirmed to cause any specific Java installation error. However, don’t rule out the possibility of corrupted system files causing installation issues on your PC. You can easily [repair corrupted Windows files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) by running System File Checker and Deployment Image Servicing and Management scans with these Command Prompt commands:

`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth  
  
sfc /scannow`

## 6\. Turn Off Antivirus Shields and Firewalls

 Disabling antivirus protection is another resolution users confirm to have fixed Java installation issues with. Doing so will ensure a real-time antivirus shield can’t block the installation of Java. So, try temporarily off the antivirus shield for any third-party security software on your PC before attempting to install Java. Right-click the security app’s icon in the system tray to select an option for disabling it.

 A firewall can also feasibly cause issues for the online Java installer at least. So, temporarily disable Microsoft Defender Firewall or a third-party alternative installed before running the Java installer to eliminate that potential cause. Our [how to turn off Microsoft Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-microsoft-defender-firewall/) guide includes instructions for disabling that firewall.

## 7\. Reboot Windows With a Clean Boot

 A clean boot is a stripped-down Windows startup that excludes third-party apps and services. Setting a clean boot stops third-party apps and services automatically starting with Windows. Applying this resolution can potentially fix some Java installation errors because it prevents third-party background apps or services from conflicting with the Java installation process.

 Our guide on [performing a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) tells you how to disable third-party startup items. When you’ve done that, have another go at installing Java after rebooting Windows 11/10\. Then you can re-enable all the disabled startup items via Task Manager and MSConfig.

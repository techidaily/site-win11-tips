## Why Does the “Your Windows License Will Expire Soon” Error Appear?

 The "Your Windows license will expire soon" error message can occur due to several factors, and here are the most prevalent ones:

* **Windows license is invalid:** Using an unauthorized or pirated version of Windows is one of the most common reasons why you might encounter this error message.
* **Hardware changes:** Performing hardware changes, such as replacing the motherboard in your system, can also lead to activation errors on Windows.
* **Connectivity issues:** Your computer might fail to connect to the Key Management Service (KMS) server due to network-related issues, resulting in activation errors.
* **Corrupt Activation Token files:** The **Tokens.dat** file contains the activation information for your Windows installation. If this file becomes inaccessible for some reason, you may encounter the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on Windows.

## 1\. Apply Some Preliminary Fixes

 Before you try any advanced troubleshooting tips, it’s a good idea to start with some basic fixes.

If it’s nothing major, you should be able to fix it by simply [restarting the Windows Explorer process](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-restart-file-explorer-windows-10/).
* **Run the SFC Scan:** It’s possible that Microsoft is having trouble authenticating your Windows license due to corrupt or damaged system files. To repair these files, you can try [running the System File Checker (SFC) scan on your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/).

2. Type **cmd** in the box and select **Run as administrator**.

## 5\. Rebuild the Tokens.dat File

 Tokens.dat is a system file related to Windows activation and licensing. If this file somehow gets corrupted, Windows may have trouble verifying the authenticity of your license and trouble you with the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error.

 You can try rebuilding the Tokens.dat file on your PC to see if that fixes the error. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** or use the **Win + X** keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu.
2. Select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
3. Type the following commands one by one and press **Enter** after each.  
`net stop sppsvc  
cd %windir%\system32\spp\store\2.0  
ren tokens.dat tokens.bar  
net start sppsvc  
cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /rilc`

 Restart your computer after running the above commands and then check if you still get the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on your PC.

## 6\. Reset the Licensing Status

Here are the steps you can follow.

1. [Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).

## Breaking Free From File Read-Only Status on PC

 When a file is marked as read-only on Windows, you can only view it and not change it in any way. This essentially protects important files from unauthorized changes.

 On Windows, you can set or remove the read-only attribute for a file by modifying its properties. Alternatively, you can also run a command in Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell to do the same. In this article, we take a look at all of them.

 Note that Windows may prevent you from changing the read-only attribute of a file if you don’t have the necessary permissions to modify the folder in which the file is located. In that case, you must take ownership of the folder first. If you need help, check our guide on[how to take ownership of folders on Windows](<http://How> to Take Ownership of Folders in Windows 10 & 11) .

## 2\. How to Change the Read-Only Attribute for Files Using the Command Prompt

 Command Prompt is one of two command-line tools available on Windows. You can use it to run batch files, troubleshoot errors, and perform various other tasks. It also lets you change a file's read-only attribute with a single command. Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Right-click on the file for which you want to modify the read-only attribute and select**Copy as path** .
2. Press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
3. Select**Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
4. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
5. In the console, type the following command and press**Enter** to set your file as read-only.  
`attrib +r "FilePath"`

 Replace**FilePath** in the above command with the actual path of the file copied earlier.

 Once you run the above command, the file will be set as read-only. Likewise, if you want to remove the read-only attribute for a file, use this command:

`attrib -r "FilePath"`

 Once you remove the read-only attribute for a file, you should be able to edit or modify it.

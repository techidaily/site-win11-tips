## Strategies to Trigger Success in Windows Service Starts

 We all use the Windows search bar first when trying to find a file or a newly installed program. However, in some situations, instead of providing search results, Windows may display an error: **Windows could not start the Windows Search service on your Local Computer.**

 In this guide, we'll look at some troubleshooting methods to resolve the Windows Search service error.

## Why Does the "Windows Search Service Could Not Start" Error Occur?

 The Windows Search service error indicates that the system is unable to call the search service. This service handles all your searches, so whenever you type something on the search bar, it automatically finds and shows you the matching results.

 Here are the main reasons that may cause the Windows Search service error:

* Corrupted system files
* A buggy Windows update
* Incorrect group policy settings
* Windows search-related services are not working
* Registry-related errors

## 1\. Apply Some General Fixes

 Try the fixes given below once and check whether you can perform a Windows search or not:

* **Run SFC to check the corrupted system files:** SFC stands for System File Checker, and it's an in-built tool that helps you repair corrupted system files. To use the tool, learn [how to run SFC on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/).
* **Run the Search and Indexing troubleshooter:** Press **Win + Q**, type **Fix Windows Search**, and double-click on the best search result to run the troubleshooter.

![Windows Search Results Screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-search-results.jpg)
* **Check for updates:** If you're experiencing issues with the Windows Search service, try [manually updating Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) once.

 These are just a few basic ways we expect to work in case of a Windows search error. But, if you're still unable to search for anything, move to some advanced troubleshooting methods.

## 2\. Restart the Relevant Windows Services

 When you boot up Windows, more than 50 services start simultaneously. This helps the operating system to function correctly, and most of these services are dependent on each other. So, if one service fails or stops for any reason, the dependent services will misbehave too.

 Let's try fixing the search issue by restarting the dependent Windows services:

1. Press **Win + R** to launch the Run dialog box.
2. Type **services.msc** in the text box. Now press **Enter** to execute the shortcutto launch the Services app window.
3. To restart the services, right-click on each of the following and select the **Restart** option: **Background Tasks Infrastructure Service**, **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**, and **Windows Update**.

![Windows Update Service In Services App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-update-service.jpg)

 That's it. Now restart your system and check for the search error. If you’re still facing the Windows search could not start error, restarting the dependent services should do the trick. So, take your time and restart the services once.

## 3\. Fix Incorrect Group Policy Settings

 Windows includes a useful app called the Group Policy Editor. This app helps administrators turn on/off more than 2000 Windows settings (or policies).

 If the **Windows Search Could Not Start** error persists on your system, the problem may lie in the misconfigured Group Policy settings. These incorrect settings can prevent the Windows Search service from starting correctly.

 Below are the steps to modify the Group Policy settings on Windows:

1. [Open the Group Policy Editor on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-local-group-policy-editor/).
2. Click on **Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Search** to access all the settings related to Windows search.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Local Group Policy Editor Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/local-group-policy-editor-windows.jpg)
3. Double-click on **Fully Disable Search UI** and select **Not Configured**. Click **OK** to save the changes and exit the settings wizard.  
![Windows Search Policy Setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-search-policy-setting.jpg)
4. You have to do the same thing, i.e., double-click, then select **Not Configured** and click **OK** with each of the following policies: **Do not allow web search**, **Configures search on the taskbar**, and **Allow search highlights**

 The Group Policy Editor is an advanced tool, and incorrect tweaks can cause system instability. So, be careful to change only the mentioned settings. If a setting is unavailable or locked on your computer, proceed to the next one.

## 4\. Enable Windows Search Service via MSConfig

 The MSConfig utility (System Configuration tool) is a built-in feature that provides a central hub for troubleshooting and managing various aspects of your system. It's pretty handy and can prove helpful for you if the Windows search service is not working.

 Here's how to enable the Windows Search service using MSConfig:

1. Open the Run dialog box again using **Win + R**.
2. Type **msconfig** inside the text field.Press **Enter** to open the MSConfig utility (System Configuration wizard).
3. At the top of the wizard, click on the **Services** tab.

![Windows System Configuration Wizard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-system-configuration-wizard.jpg)
4. Scroll down the list and look for the **Windows Search** service.
5. If it's unchecked, check the box next to **Windows Search** to enable it, then click **Apply** and **OK**.  
![Windows Search In MSConfig](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-search-in-msconfig.jpg)

 Besides this, MSConfig has many other use cases. Read our in-depth guide on [Microsoft System Configuration Utility (MSConfig)](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-msconfig-guide/) to know some of them.

## 5\. Delete Files in the Windows TxR Directory

 TxR (Transaction Resource Manager) is a directory (folder) that keeps track of all the changes you make to Windows files.

 We assume a malicious program has somehow messed with the system files. And so, this change is already recorded in the TxR directory. To fix the issue, we'll delete the files in this directory to check how things were before the search issue occurred.

 Follow the below-given steps to delete files in the TxR directory on Windows:

1. Open the File Explorer by pressing **Win + E**.
2. Navigate to the TxR directory (**C:\\windows\\system32\\config\\TxR**). The first time you open the folder, it'll show **This folder is empty**.  
![Windows TxR Directory Path](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-txr-directory-path.jpg)
3. Click on **View** at the top bar of the File Explorer. Then, go to **Show** and tick **Hidden items**.  
![Hidden Items File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hidden-items-file-explorer.jpg)
4. Similarly, click on the three-dot menu at the top. Click **Options > View**. Scroll down and uncheck or disable **Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![File Explorer Folder Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/file-explorer-folder-options.jpg)
5. Now all the files inside the directory should be visible to you. Please select all the files (**Ctrl + A**) and then delete them.  
![Windows TxR Directory Files](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-txr-directory-files.jpg)

 The steps might seem too complex, but the screenshots should help you. Besides, as Microsoft recommends, there's no harm in deleting the files in case of search service-related errors.

## 6\. Reset Windows Search

 Microsoft provides a PowerShell script on their website to reset Windows search. We'll show you how to use it and get the search service working on your computer again.

 To get started, download the [Reset Windows Search PowerShell script](https://www.microsoft.com/En-Us/Download/details.aspx?Id=100295). Go to your downloads folder and double-click on the downloaded script file (with a **.PS1** extension).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![PowerShell Script Context Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/powershell-script-context-menu.jpg)

 The script will now reset the search-related options and settings to their default state. Once done, open the Windows search bar and type something to check whether it's working.

## 7\. Reinstall Windows

 Unfortunately, if none of the solutions worked, your last option is reinstalling Windows. For this, see [how to reinstall Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-reinstall-without-deleting-apps/). There's no need to worry; this reinstallation will not remove any important files and apps.

 We understand this is a big step as no one would love to re-set up the whole system again. But don't worry; to help you better, here's a guide on [post-Windows installation setup](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-things-to-do-after-updating/). Follow it, and you can enhance your new Windows setup twofold.

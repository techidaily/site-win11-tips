## Accelerated Workflow: Customizing Windows Clipboard

 While copy-pasting on a PC is a handy tool to have on hand, the Windows clipboard doesn’t enable users to create custom hotkeys for pasting pre-defined text snippets.

 QuickTextPaste and HotkeyP are third-party Windows apps with which you can set up alternative custom hotkeys for pasting text snippets. This is how you can create unique hotkeys for pasting addresses, names, numbers, and other text snippets you’ll often need to input into word processors or browsers with those apps.

## How to Set Up Hotkeys for Pasting Pre-Defined Text With QuickTextPaste

 QuickTextPaste is freeware software for Windows 11, 10, 8.1, and 7\. It’s a lightweight program that enables you to set up and save custom [hotkeys](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-hotkey-how-to-make-custom/) with which you can always paste pre-defined text whenever needed. Plus, you can set custom hotkeys for opening apps with that software. You can set up a hotkey for pasting pre-defined text with QuickTextPaste as follows:

1. Open [this QuickTextPaste](https://www.softwareok.com/?Download=QuickTextPaste) download page.
2. Click the**QuickTextPaste\_x64.zip** download link.
3. Press the**Windows** logo +**E** keyboard buttons to open the file manager and go to the directory the QuickTextPaste ZIP downloaded.
4. Follow the steps in this guide about [unzipping files within Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to extract the QuickTextPaste archive.  
![The Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/extract-compressed-window.jpg)
5. Double-click**QuickTextPaste\_x64.exe** to run QuickTextPaste.
6. Now input some text you want to set up a custom paste hotkey for within the**Add** **text** box.  
![The QuickTextPaste window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-quicktextpaste-window.jpg)
7. Select the keys to include within your hotkey on the two drop-down menus at the bottom of the QuickTextPaste window.
8. Press the**Add** button. You should see your new hotkey listed within the Keyboard Shortcuts column.

 You can now try out your new custom paste hotkey. Click QuickTextPaste’s**To-Tray** button to minimize the app to the system tray area. Open Notepad, or any other text editor or word processor, to paste in. Then press whatever custom hotkey you set up to paste in its predefined text snippet.

 To set up some program hotkeys, input**run: <application file name>** within the**Add** text box. For example, input**run: msedge.exe** to set up an Edge hotkey. Select the key combination for running the software in the drop-down menus.

![A run Edge hotkey](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/run-edge-hotkey.jpg)

 QuickTextPaste has a 4,000-character limit for text snippets. However, that’s not an especially big restriction. You can probably fit up to 600 words within a 4,000-character limit.

 QuickTextPaste needs to be running in the background for its hotkeys to work. You can set the program to run automatically by clicking**Action** \>**Start** **with Windows** . Select the**Always start minimized (ToTray)** option to set the program to appear only in the system tray area when started.

## How to Set up Hotkeys for Pasting Pre-Defined Text With HotkeyP

 HotkeyP is a lightweight app with which you can set up a wide variety of system, display, multimedia, window, and macro hotkeys. As it’s a portable program, you can utilize it on most Windows platforms with no installation necessary. These are the steps for setting up a custom paste hotkey for pre-defined text with HotkeyP:

1. Open this [HotkeyP page](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/HotkeyP.shtml) on Softpedia.
2. Select**Download** on the HotkeyP page.
3. Click the**External Mirror - x64** option for a 64-bit version of the software.
4. Go into Explorer and open the folder your hotkeyp\_64bit ZIP file downloaded in.
5. Unzip the**hotkeyp\_64bit.zip** archive by right-clicking it and selecting**Extract All** . Click**Show extracted files** **when complete** \>**Extract** within the extraction tool.  
![The Extract All context menu option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/extract-all-option.jpg)

1. Double-click**HotkeyP.exe** within the hotkeyp\_64bit folder.
2. Click**Add** to bring up a Hot Key window.  
![The HotkeyP window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hotkeyp.jpg)
3. Next, press the arrow (**<**) button for the**Command** box.
4. Select**Macro** and the**Paste text** option.  
![The Paste text option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/paste-text-option.jpg)
5. Then input the text to paste within the**Parameters** box. That parameters box doesn’t seem to have any character number restriction for how long your pre-defined text can be.
6. Select one or more**Ctrl** ,**Alt** ,**Win** , and**Shift** checkboxes.
7. Input a letter key within the text box to set the hotkey.
8. Enter a title for the hotkey in the**Description** box.  
![The Hot Key window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hot-key-window.jpg)
9. Select**OK** to add the new custom paste hotkey.

 Now you’ll see the hotkey you’ve just set listed within the HotkeyP window. Press**Esc** to hide the HotkeyP in the system tray. Then open WordPad, Notepad, or another text editor to try out the hotkey. Press the custom hotkey you’ve set up to paste in its pre-defined text.

 When you need to modify a hotkey or its text, select it in HotkeyP and click**Edit** . Then you can adjust the parameter and key configuration within the Hot Key window again. To remove a hotkey, select a keyboard shortcut and click**Delete** .

 You can configure general settings for HotkeyP by clicking**Window** \>**Options** . The**Start automatically at Windows startup** checkbox is already selected by default on the**General** tab. That tab also includes options for adding/removing buttons in the main window, setting buttons for hiding the window and showing the program in the system tray among others.

## Creating Other Hotkeys With HotkeyP

 It’s also worth exploring the other options for creating hotkeys HotkeyP offers beyond pasting pre-defined text. For example, you can set up custom hotkeys for various system functions like shutting down, logging off, emptying the Recycle Bin, and opening the Programs and Features applet among others. To do so, click the**arrow (<)** button and**System** on the Hot Key window to choose one of those hotkey functions.

![The System hotkey options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/system-hotkey-options.jpg)

 Or you can set up some custom window control hotkeys. Select**Window** on the command menu to view the various window keyboard shortcut options. There you can select**Always on Top** ,**Maximize window** ,**Minimize others** ,**Window snapshot,** **Close window** , and**Opacity** hotkey options, to name a few.

 You can set up a program keyboard shortcut by selecting an app’s path within the Hot Key window. Click the**ellipses (…)** button for the**Command** box to select a program for a keyboard shortcut to open. Then you can also select additional**Process priority** and**Run as administrator** settings for the software the hotkey launches.

## Create Handy Hotkeys for Pasting Pre-Defined Text in Windows

 Custom hotkeys for pasting pre-defined text will certainly come in handy for filling out web forms and drafting letters or emails. You can set up custom keyboard shortcuts for pasting your name, postcode, phone number, email address, tax reference number, passwords, and much more with QuickTextPaste and HotkeyP. They’re good apps to utilize for creating software hotkeys as well.

## What is Windows Color Management?

 When it comes to color management, it isn't just about getting the right colors on your screen; the colors should also match across devices. It plays an essential role for graphic designers and photographers to ensure that the colors on their screens match those on their final products.

 However, when working with colors on Windows, you might have noticed that sometimes the colors look off. This can be due to a number of factors, but one of the most common is an issue with color management.

 Another possibility is that your monitor is not calibrated correctly.

 The last resort is to perform a factory reset on Windows. A factory reset is when you delete everything on your computer and start from scratch. This is a good way to fix color management because it gets rid of any corrupt files that might be causing the problem.

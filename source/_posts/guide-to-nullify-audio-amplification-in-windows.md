 Audio enhancements can improve your listening experience but sometimes cause audio problems. If you're experiencing poor sound quality or other audio issues, disabling Windows audio enhancements may help.

 In this article, we'll show a few methods to disable audio enhancements via the Settings app and the Control Panel.

 Close the Settings window after you've made these changes. This will disable all audio enhancements for your speakers on Windows.

 If you would like to enable audio enhancements on Windows, simply repeat the steps above and select the enhancement available for your device. It's as easy as that.

## 2\. How to Disable Audio Enhancements via the Control Panel

 Another way to disable audio enhancements is through the Control Panel. This is a bit longer process, but it offers more details.

 Follow these steps to disable audio enhancements using the Control Panel:

1. [Open Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) and select **Hardware and Sound**.
2. Under the **Sound** category, select **Manage audio devices**.

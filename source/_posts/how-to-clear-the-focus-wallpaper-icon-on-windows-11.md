## How to Clear the Focus Wallpaper Icon on Windows 11

 Spotlight is a feature that adds different Bing images to Windows 11’s desktop background when enabled. That feature also adds a "Learn about this picture" icon to the desktop you can double-click to bring up image info. Right-clicking that icon brings up a context menu that includes a **Switch to next picture** option.

 The context menu doesn’t currently have an option for deleting the "Learn about this picture" icon. Maybe Microsoft might add such an option in a future version of Windows 11\. However, you can remove the Spotlight wallpaper icon from the desktop without a delete option with the methods below.

## How to Remove the Spotlight Desktop Icon With a Manual Registry Tweak

 A relatively simple registry tweak is required to remove the "Learn about this picture" icon from the Windows Spotlight wallpaper. These are the steps for removing the Spotlight desktop icon by manually tweaking the registry:

1. Launch Run by right-clicking **Start** (the taskbar icon) and selecting **Run**.
2. Enter **regedit** inside Run’s **Open** command box and select **OK** to [access the Registry Editor app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/).
3. Next, go to this **NewStartPanel** key by inputting its path in the registry address bar:  
`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\HideDesktopIcons\NewStartPanel`
4. Right-click **NewStartPanel** and select **New** to view a submenu with options for adding new registry entries.

5. Click **DWORD (32-bit) Value** on the submenu.

1. Copy **{2cc5ca98-6485-489a-920e-b3e88a6ccce3}** to your clipboard by selecting the text and pressing **Ctrl** \+ **C**. Then press **Ctrl** \+ **V** to paste that into the DWORD’s name text box.
2. Double-click the **{2cc5ca98-6485-489a-920e-b3e88a6ccce3}** DWORD you just added.
3. Delete **0** in the **Value data** box.
4. Input **1** in the **Value data** box and click **OK**.

5. Click Registry Editor’s **X** window button.
6. Right-click any empty part of the desktop and select **Refresh**. The "Learn about this picture icon" will no longer be on the desktop.

 If you ever want to restore that Spotlight icon, you can do so by changing the value of the {**2cc5ca98-6485-489a-920e-b3e88a6ccce3}** DWORD you added to the registry. Double-click **{2cc5ca98-6485-489a-920e-b3e88a6ccce3}** in the **NewStartPanel** key to input **0** in that DWORD’s **Value data** box. Refreshing the desktop will then restore the "Learn about this picture" icon.

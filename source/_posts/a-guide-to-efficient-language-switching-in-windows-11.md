 You can get more keyboard layouts by adding a new language. However, this requires the internet to download the new language. So, [make sure you're connected to the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-connect-to-wifi/), and follow the steps below:

1. On the **Language & Region** page in Settings (step #1 above), click **Add a Language**.
2. In the pop-up, select the language you want to install and click **Next**.

3. Click **Install** for Windows 11 to download and install the new language.
4. Follow steps #2 and #3 above to add a new keyboard layout to the language you just installed.

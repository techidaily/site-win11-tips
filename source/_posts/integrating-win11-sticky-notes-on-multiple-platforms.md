1. Click on the Windows Search bar or use the shortcut **Windows + Q**.
2. Search for “Sticky Notes”, then click on the app from the search results.

 Rather than offering a separate sticky notes app, Microsoft features Windows Sticky Notes as part of the Microsoft OneNote app. This [less-known feature of Microsoft OneNote](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-little-known-onenote-features-will-love/) is great for those who already have experience using OneNote, although, this trick can be easily learned by anyone.

1. Go to the App Store and search for Microsoft OneNote.
2. After installation, sign in using your Microsoft account.
3. In the bottom right corner of the homepage, tap on **Sticky Notes**.

## Troubleshooting the Self-Opens Issue with MSDN/Store

 The Microsoft Store has come a long way since its introduction to Windows 8\. Every app, game, or movie available on the store is certified, so you don’t have to worry about infecting your computer with malware.

 But what if Windows keeps opening the Microsoft Store for no apparent reason? If you’ve run into the same issue, this guide should help you fix it.

##

## 1\. Close Microsoft Store's Background Processes

 Windows might keep opening the Microsoft Store if there’s a process still running in the background. To fix it, you should use Task Manager to stop any background activity.

 Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to bring up Task Manager. There, right-click**Microsoft Store** and select**End task** .

## 2\. Restart the Microsoft Store Services

 There’s a chance that the Microsoft Store keeps acting up because of a service malfunction. The Microsoft Store Install Service is the one that works in the background to keep the store working.

 This is why restarting the service might be enough to fix Microsoft Store.

1. In the Start menu search bar, search for**services** and select**Run as administrator** .
2. In the Services window, locate and open**Microsoft Store Install Service** .
3. Click**Stop > Start** to restart it.
4. Restart your computer and monitor if Microsoft Store keeps opening.

## 3\. Re-register Microsoft Store

 If nothing worked until now, you could re-register the Microsoft Store app. To do it, launch PowerShell with administrative rights and paste this code:

`Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<strong> </strong>`

 Then, press**Enter** to run it.

## Fix the Microsoft Store App Opening Itself

 Having the Microsoft Store app open by itself can be very disruptive, especially if it opens on top of all windows. Hopefully, one of these solutions worked and Microsoft Store has stopped launching by itself.

 If you’ve had enough and uninstalled it, you can still get Microsoft apps without the Microsoft Store.

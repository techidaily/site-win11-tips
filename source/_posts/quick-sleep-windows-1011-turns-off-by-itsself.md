## Automate a Windows Shut Down When It Goes Idle

 You can use Command Prompt and Task Scheduler to automate system shutdown in Windows 11 and 10 computers. However, unlike Command Prompt, Task Scheduler offers better task automation and supports more conditions. You can also configure it to automate Windows start-up.

## Unifying MS Office Suite with Your Zoho Online Platform: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you been looking to integrate MS Office install and your Zoho online account? Then join us as we look at the Zoho Plugin for Microsoft Office.

 Note: Compatible with Office 2000 and above (English Language versions only).

**Using the Zoho Office Plugin** 

 For our example we created a document in Zoho Writer online before installing the plugin.

 The installation itself will be quick and simple. There will also be a program folder created in Program Files.

 When the installation process has finished, both Word and Excel are set to start by default.

 To access Zoho in Word and/or Excel go to the Add-Ins Tab and login into your Zoho account.

 Note: We focused on Word only for our article.

![zoho-plugin-05](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin05.png) 

 Once you have logged in, the plugin will access your online account.

![zoho-plugin-06](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin06.png) 

 At this point you are ready to open and work on your files.

![zoho-plugin-07](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin07.png) 

 When you go to open an online document you will be presented with a list to choose from. We decided to access the document that we created earlier.

![zoho-plugin-08](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin08.png) 

 There is our online document looking very nice in Word.

![zoho-plugin-09](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin09.png) 

 As a test we added the following bit of text to the document.

![zoho-plugin-10](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin10.png) 

 Saving documents works just as quickly as opening them.

![zoho-plugin-11](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin11.png) 

 After saving the document we checked our online account. As you can see the new text was available in the online version.

![zoho-plugin-12](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin12.png) 

 You can also save your documents locally by using the regular save function in Microsoft Word.

 Note: The plugin will automatically use your account name as the local folder's name.

![zoho-plugin-13](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/zohoplugin13.png) 

 Any documents saved locally will be placed in a special Zoho folder in My Documents on your computer.

 Accessing locally saved documents will require you to enter your Zoho account password (which adds a nice bit of security for your documents).

 Note: In this instance we totally shut Word down and restarted as part of the test.

## How to Make Calls From Your Phone Using the Intel Unison App on Windows 11

 Apple’s integrated ecosystem of devices makes it easy to transfer data between a mac and an iPhone. Windows users longed for this integration for many years until Microsoft launched the Phone Link app. But even that has its limitations, primarily because it is a Microsoft-owned product.

 Intel Unison is the talk of the town because it supports both iPhone and Android phones. So, you can access the phone storage, check messages and notifications, and even make calls using the Unison app. This post will share the detailed steps to make calls from your Windows 11 PC without lifting your phone.

## Why Can’t You Call Someone Directly Using Intel Unison?

 During the initial setup process of the Intel Unison app, it asks for a bunch of phone permissions. The list includes your phone storage, contacts, and messages. You must give location permissions to proceed with the app setup process. During that, the Intel Unison app also demands Bluetooth access on your phone. But why can’t it make calls?

 The reason behind this issue is that you haven’t paired your Windows 11 laptop with your phone’s Bluetooth. When you open the calls interface in the desktop app, it displays a blank screen with a message to pair with the mobile phone via Bluetooth and give access to phone contacts. So, you need to enable Bluetooth connectivity on your laptop and then pair it with the phone which has the Intel Unison app.

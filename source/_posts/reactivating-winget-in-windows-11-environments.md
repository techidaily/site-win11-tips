## Reactivating Winget in Windows 11 Environments

 Winget is a command-line tool that can download and install app packages from MS Store and the apps listed in its repository. It saves a lot of time that would be otherwise wasted in searching the Microsoft Store or the web for a particular app, downloading it, and then manually installing it.

 But some users report that Winget is not working on their PC. They face a "The system cannot execute the specified program" and cannot run any commands, This post will discuss multiple methods to resolve the issue and restore Winget to its working state. Let’s begin.

## Reasons Why Winget Stops Working on Windows

 Here are the following reasons why Winget is not working on your Windows PC:

1. You are running an outdated version of the App Installer.
2. Winget servers are down, or you don’t have an active internet connection.
3. The app execution alias is not configured or inactive for Winget.
4. App Installer failed to add the PATH environment variable automatically while installing.

 Now, you know the reasons behind Winget not working issue. Try out these eight methods to resolve the issue and use your favorite package manager again.

## 1\. Close and Reopen Winget in the Terminal App

 Before moving on to advanced fixes, completely close the Command Prompt or PowerShell instance you are running on the PC. You can use the Task Manager to stop an unresponsive instance of either of these command-line tools.

 After that, open Command Prompt or PowerShell with administrator privileges on your system. Type Winget and press the **Enter** key to check if Winget works now.

## 2\. Check if the Winget Servers Are Down

 Winget is an online tool that needs a robust internet connection to search for a package in various repositories and then download and install them. If the Winget servers are down or inactive, it won’t be able to fetch results from repositories. So, check if Winget servers are down using [DownDetector](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk%5F168667664973511&key=eac202ea7a96cf485281d6c4ffa2069e&libId=liuggg0i0103es17000ULlmtlntd&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fhow-to-fix-0x8004def5-onedrive-error-code-windows-11%2F&ccpaConsent=1---&v=1&opt=true&optExText=false&out=https%3A%2F%2Fdowndetector.com%2F&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fauthor%2Fabhishekkumar-mishra%2F&title=9%20Ways%20to%20Fix%20the%200x8004def5%20OneDrive%20Error%20Code%20on%20Windows%2011&txt=DownDetector) or a similar website.

 You can also check if your Windows PC can connect to the internet. Simply open a web browser and access a website or run a web-based app to confirm internet connectivity. If the servers are down, you will have to wait until they come up live again to use Winget.

## 3\. Perform a Complete System Shutdown

 Windows uses Fast Startup to hibernate kernel-level processes and if any of these glitch, they remain in that state after your power on the system. So, perform a complete shutdown to close and relaunch all the core services and then try to run Winget. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** keys to [open the Command Prompt with administrator privileges](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. Now, type the following command and press the Enter key: **shutdown /s /f /t 0**  
![Completely Shutdown your PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/completely-shutdown-your-pc.jpg)
3. Your system will shut down. It will take longer than a usual shutdown because Windows will close everything.
4. Power on your system and try to run Winget using the Terminal app to check if it works now.

## 4\. Update App Installer

 Winget is a part of Windows 10 and 11 now and is shipped to PCs using the App Installer application. If you haven’t updated the App Installer in a while, you can face issues in running Winget and managing packages. Winget is included only in version 1.11.11451 or higher of the App Installer. If you have a version older than that, you cannot use Winget from the terminal.

 So, open Microsoft Store and check the library section for any pending updates for the App Installer. Manually search and install the update and check if Winget works now.

## 7\. Re-register Winget Using PowerShell

 If Winget isn’t working on your PC, you can re-register it using PowerShell. Since it is a part of the App Installer which is a system app, it is possible to re-register it. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box. Type **PowerShell** and press the **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** keys at once.
2. The PowerShell window will launch with admin rights. Paste the following code and press the **Enter** key to execute it:  
`Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Winget.Source_2021.718.1322.843_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppXManifest.xml" -Verbose`
3. You won’t see any confirmation message after the command executes successfully. Close the PowerShell window and restart your PC.

## 8\. Try Some Generic Windows Fixes

 If none of the methods work for you, try our generic fixes like SFC and DISM scans that find and fix the system file corruption and service Windows Image components. You must [run the SFC scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) first and allow it to find and replace the corrupt system files, if any. After that, [run the DISM scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) in online mode.

 After running these scans, you can use System Restore to revert the PC to a point in time when everything worked fine. Lastly, you can perform a complete system reset. You can choose the Keep my files option to preserve all your files while [factory resetting Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/).

## Quick Fixes for Lost Internet Connection

 When Windows fails to establish a network connection, it will likely display that you aren't connected to any network. You may encounter this error in the network adapter status dialog or on the Network tab in the Settings app.

 This error is often triggered due to temporary glitches, bad network adapter drivers, and issues with your Wi-Fi router or modem. Even a loose Ethernet connection can trigger this error, so make sure your Ethernet cable is firmly connected. If the issue persists, try the additional steps described below.

## 4\. Update Your Adapter's Network Driver

![update network driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/update-network-driver.jpg)

 If a reinstall didn't help, try to update your network adapter driver. An outdated or buggy driver can create compatibility issues. Also, if you have upgraded your OS to a newer version, your system may be missing newer driver updates.

 Try to update the network device driver using Device Manager. Alternatively, you can also directly download it from the manufacturer's website.

To update network drivers using Device Manager:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX menu** .
2. Click on**Device Manager.**
3. In Device Manager, expand the**Network adapters** section.
4. Right-click on your network adapter and select**Update driver.**
5. Click on**Search automatically for drivers** . Windows will look for new drivers. If available, download and install the drivers.
6. Once installed, restart your PC and check for any improvements.

 Often Device Manager fails to find the latest drivers for the network adapter. To remedy this issue, check your computer manufacturer's website for new device drivers.

To download the drivers:

1. Visit your computer manufacturer's website and enter your product details.
2. In the download center, look for network driver updates.
3. Download and complete the driver installation to see if the error is resolved.

 Additionally, use the built-in system management utility offered by your computer manufacturer. For example, HP laptops come with an HP Support Assistant utility. You can use it to find new drivers for networking and other devices on your PC.

## 5\. Perform a Windows Network Reset

 Windows features a network reset feature as part of advanced network settings. When you perform a network reset, it removes and reinstalls the network drivers and resets other networking components to their factory default.

 A network reset can help if the error is triggered due to issues with your network configuration. Here's how to perform a network reset.

1. Click on**Start** and then select**Settings** .
2. Open the**Network & internet** tab in the left pane.  
![advanced network settings windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/advanced-network-settings-windows-11-2.jpg)
3. Scroll down and click on**Advanced network settings.**  
![network reset windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/network-reset-windows-11.jpg)
4. Next, click on**Network reset** .  
![network reset reset now windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/network-reset-reset-now-windows-11.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Click the**Reset** now button for**Network reset.**
6. Click**Yes** to confirm the action.

 Windows will reset your network adapters and other components and restart your PC. After the restart, check if you can connect to the Internet.

## 6\. Check Your Modem and/or Router for Issues

 This error can occur if your computer is not receiving any communication from the modem. Try connecting another device, such as your mobile device, to the network to check your network status.

 If the issue exists on all devices, troubleshoot your router for issues. Start by performing a quick power restart for the router. If that does not help, try performing a factory reset.

To reset your Wi-Fi router:

1. Make sure the router is powered on.
2. Locate the small**Reset** button on the rear panel.
3. Use a paper clip to press and hold the reset button for**10 seconds** . Release the button and wait for the router to restart.

## 7\. Perform a System Restore

 If you suspect a Windows update to have triggered the error, try a system restore using a restore point. A restore point helps you undo any recently made changes by updates and individuals without affecting your files and folders.

To perform a system restore using the restore point:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**rstrui.exe** and click**OK** .
3. In the**System Restore** dialog, click**Next** .  
![select restore point windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/select-restore-point-windows-11.jpg)

## Fixing the "You Are Not Connected to Any Networks" Error on Windows

 You can fix this error using the built-in network adapter troubleshooter. Alternatively, reinstall a generic network adapter driver, update your driver or perform a network reset. As a last resort, use a recent restore point to restore your PC to its last working state.

## Secret Passages to Your PC: Mastering RDP on Win 11

 Remote Desktop connections let two computers share data and applications online. It's handy for accessing files and programs from afar. Although security measures often require passwords. But what if you could connect to your remote desktop without it? This article explains how to connect to a remote desktop without a password in Windows 11\.

## 1\. Using Group Policy

 A group policy editor is a tool administrators use to set user access control policies. You can use this feature to disable passwords. Make sure you are running Windows Pro, Enterprise, or Education Edition.

 Note that Windows Home Edition does not support Group Policy because it is a non-domain system. However, you can enable Local Group Policy Editor on your Windows Home device.

 To allow remote desktop connections without passwords, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to [open the Run dialogue box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/).
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the text field box and hit Enter. The Local Group Policy Editor will open as a result.
3. In the left-hand navigation pane, expand the **Computer Configuration** policy sets.
4. Then navigate to the following folders:  
Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options
5. In the right panel, double-click on **Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only**. The Properties window will pop up.

6. Choose **Disabled** and click **OK** to save the changes.  
![Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/limit-local-account-use-of-blank-passwords-to-console-logon-only.jpg)

 This will allow users to connect remotely without using a password. If you want to enable the password prompt again, just follow the same steps and select **Enabled** instead of **Disabled** in the last step.

## 2\. Using Security Policy

 Security policies are another way to connect remotely without passwords. This tool is similar to the group policy editor but specific to the local computer. This means any changes you make to the local security policy will only apply to the local computer while group policies are domain-wide.

 To make passwordless remote connections using a security policy, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + S** on your keyboard to open the Windows Search.
2. Type **secpol.msc** in the search bar and hit Enter.
3. Select the result from the top of the list to open the Local Security Policy.
4. In the left-hand navigation pane, navigate to the following folders:  
Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options
5. Now move to the right panel and double-click on **Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only**. This will open the Properties window for this policy.  
![Use Security Policy to Connect Remote Desktop Without a Password](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/use-security-policy-to-connect-remote-desktop-without-a-password.jpg)
6. Select **Disabled** and click on **Apply > OK** to save changes.

 Once you save this setting, remote connections are possible without passwords.

 To enable the password prompt again, go through the same steps and double-click on the policy. When the Properties window opens, select **Enabled**. Click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes.

## 3\. Using Registry Editor

 When running Windows Home, use the registry editor instead of the group policy editor. The registry editor is a hierarchical database that stores system configuration and settings.

 However, be careful when using it as one mistake can permanently damage your system and cause data loss. Therefore, you always [back up your registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making changes.

 To make remote desktop connections without a password on Windows Home, follow these steps:

1. Click on Start and type **regedit** in the search box.
2. Select the **Registry Editor** option from the results list.
3. If UAC (User Account Control) pops up, click on **Yes** to grant permission. This will open the Registry Editor on your screen.
4. In the left-hand sidebar, navigate to the following registry key:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
5. In the right panel, double-click on **LimitBlankPasswordUse**. The Edit DWORD window will pop up.  
![Make remote desktop connections using Registry](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/make-remote-desktop-connections-using-registry.jpg)
6. Change the **Value data** field to **0** and click **OK** to save changes.

 This will prevent Windows from requiring a password when connecting remotely.

 If you ever want to re-enable the password prompt, navigate back to the same registry key and change the value data field to **1**. Now close the Registry Editor and you are ready to connect remotely without a password.

## 4\. Using Command Prompt

 If you prefer the command line over graphical tools, try this method. It works the same way as the registry editor but is done through the command prompt. Since this could be difficult for novice users, double-check each step. This ensures you don't make mistakes and damage your system.

 To enable passwordless remote connections using the command prompt, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on **Start** and select **Run** from the menu.
2. Type **cmd** in the text field and press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** simultaneously.
3. If the UAC dialog box pops up, click **Yes** to grant permission. This will open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.

4. Now type the following command and hit Enter.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Reg add “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa” /v LimitBlankPasswordUse /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

 Running this command will change the value data field to **0** and disable the remote password prompt.

 If you ever want to re-enable the password prompt, run the same command but replace the **0** at the end with a **1**. This way the command will look like this.

Reg add “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa” /v LimitBlankPasswordUse /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

## 5\. Using a Reg File

 If you're not good at editing with the registry editor, create a .reg file instead. The .reg files are basically text files with predefined instructions. When executed, they change the registry and apply settings automatically.

 To create a .reg file, follow these steps:

1. Open Notepad (see [how to open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) for methods).
2. Copy and paste the following:  
`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa  
"LimitBlankPasswordUse"=dword:00000000`
3. Now click **File** \> **Save as** and set the file type to **All files**.  
![Create a Reg File Connect Remote Desktop Without a Password](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/create-a-reg-file-connect-remote-desktop-without-a-password.jpg)
4. Name the file **no-password.reg** and save it to your desktop.
5. Double-click on the file to execute it and apply the settings automatically.

 Your remote connections will now run without passwords. To re-enable the password prompt, create another text file with the following code:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa  
"LimitBlankPasswordUse"=dword:00000001`

 Now save the file as **enabled\_password.reg** and double-click it to apply the changes.

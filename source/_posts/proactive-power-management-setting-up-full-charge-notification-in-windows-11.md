## Proactive Power Management: Setting Up Full Charge Notification in Windows 11

 Laptop batteries degrade when kept charged at 100 percent. The more you leave a laptop plugged in, the more its battery will deteriorate over time. So, some users no doubt try to preserve their laptops’ battery lifespans by leaving them unplugged as much as possible.

 Windows doesn’t incorporate a high-battery notifier (alert) for informing you when a plugged-in laptop is fully charged or close to it. Such a feature would be useful for users who prefer to leave their laptops unplugged when they can. This is how you can add a full battery charge alert to Windows 11/10 with three apps.

## How to Add a Full Battery Charge Alert With Battery Notification

 Battery Notification is a Microsoft Store app you can utilize in Windows 11/10\. That app enables you to set both high and low-battery alert notifications. The basic app is freely available, but you can upgrade it to one with battery analytics for $4.99\. You can set up a fully charged notifier with Battery Notification as follows:

1. Bring up the[Battery Notification](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/battery-notification/9WZDNCRD31FK) app page in a browser.
2. Click Battery Notification’s**Get in Store App** option.
3. Select**Open in Microsoft Store** to access a download option for the app outside the browser.
4. Click**Get** to install Battery Notification.
5. Select Battery Notification on the Start menu to open its window.
6. Next, select the**Always Allowed** option if prompted to enable the app to run in the background.  
![The Always Allowed option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/always-allowed-option.jpg)
7. Click the app’s**Home** tab if it’s not selected.
8. Then turn on the**Full Battery Notification** option if it’s disabled. A high battery alert will now pop up when the battery reaches the level set on the**Notification** bar.  
![The Full Battery Notification option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/full-battery-notification-option.jpg)

 You can apply some optional tweaking of the full battery notifier after enabling it. Drag the slider on the**Notification level** bar to set a battery charge percentage level. If you only want the alarm to ring for a fully charged battery, set that bar to 100 percent. Drag the slider left to set the notifier to appear at lower charge levels.

 You can also change the notification’s sound. Click**Default notification sound** to view a list of alarm sounds. To preview a sound, click its play button. Press the**Set audio** option to select an alternative.

 This app also has a handy taskbar indicator for your battery. The app’s taskbar icon shows the percentage level of your batter. Thus, you can keep an eye on the battery level on the taskbar when Battery Notification is open.

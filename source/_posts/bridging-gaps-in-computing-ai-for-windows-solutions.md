## 2\. Enhanced Security

![A PC screen showing a Security text](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/security.jpg)

 AI-based security systems can detect threats and attacks that may be missed by traditional systems. These systems, like Windows 10’s Microsoft Defender, use machine learning to analyze behavioral patterns and identify anomalies that indicate security threats.

 Consequently, AI-powered antivirus software can detect and block malware in real-time. They scan files and programs for malicious code and identify and remove it before it can do any damage. What’s more, they can monitor user behavior and detect suspicious activities.

 For example, if a user suddenly starts accessing files or applications they don't normally use, the system can flag this as suspicious behavior and take appropriate action.

 Furthermore, AI-based security systems can use predictive analysis to identify potential threats before they occur. They can analyze data from various sources to identify patterns and trends that could indicate potential attacks.

 AI is revolutionizing Windows software security by providing more intelligent systems that can detect and prevent cyber-attacks in real-time, making computers more secure and reliable for end-users.

## 3\. Automated Updates

 AI has introduced several quality-of-life features to Windows users. One such feature is automated updates, which use machine learning to help Windows users keep up with the latest software updates and security patches.

 Traditionally, updating Windows software is a manual process that requires users to download and install updates themselves, which is time-consuming and lead to security vulnerabilities. With automated updates, AI algorithms can detect the latest software patches, download, and install them without user intervention.

 Fortunately, Microsoft still lets you[update Windows manually](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) if need be, so the option isn't totally gone. However, Windows does do a good job automating the update process.

 AI algorithms can also analyze usage patterns and system performance data to identify potential issues that could impact software stability or security. By analyzing this data, AI can recommend updates that can improve the performance or stability of a user's system.

## 4\. Predictive Text and Autocorrect

![person typing on keyboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/person_typing_on_keyboard.jpg)

 Predictive text uses machine learning to analyze typed words and phrases and suggests the most likely next word or phrase based on the context of the text. These text prediction functions save users time and improve their typing accuracy, especially on Windows PCs.

 On the other hand, autocorrect uses algorithms to identify and correct spelling and grammatical errors as users type. This is especially helpful for people who struggle with spelling or typing accuracy, and for non-native speakers who are unfamiliar with the language’s nuances.

 Predictive text and autocorrect rely on AI and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions based on that data. As these algorithms continue to improve and become more accurate, we can expect to see even more sophisticated versions of these tools in our Windows software.

## 5\. An Enhanced Gaming Experience

![A woman playing a game on a Desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pexels-rodnae-productions-7915437.jpg)

## 6\. Improved Search Functionality

![Screenshot of Google Chrome on macOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-google-chrome-on-macos.JPG)

 There is no doubt that AI has greatly improved search functionality on applications, web browsers, and even Windows’ search bar.

 AI can understand natural language queries and respond with relevant results. This enables users to search for files, folders, and applications using normal language instead of specific keywords. It can also suggest queries based on search history and current context, enabling users to save time by choosing a suggested search query instead of typing one out themselves.

 Moreover, AI can learn from users' search behavior to provide more accurate and relevant search results over time. As a consequence, searches become more personalized and useful as users continue to search for content.

 Ultimately, Windows employs artificial intelligence to analyze and index the contents of files and folders to provide more accurate search results. This feature allows users to search for specific content within files, such as a keyword in a document or a specific image in a folder.

## Sharing Made Simple With Nearby Share on Android

 Sharing files between Android and Windows used to be a cumbersome process with no straightforward way to do it. Thankfully, all of that has changed with Google’s Nearby Share app for Windows.

 If you are looking for more functionality, however, you can use Microsoft’s Phone Link app to access your phone’s contacts, messages, call logs, photos, and more on your Windows PC.

### Key Takeaways

* You can easily add different keyboard layouts in Windows 11 in the Settings app and then switch to them from the system tray.
* You can download additional keyboard layouts by adding a new language to your system.
* If you want to remove a keyboard layout or language, you can do so with a few clicks in the Settings app.

 Windows offers more keyboard layouts beyond QWERTY. With a few clicks, you can add a new keyboard layout, such as DVORAK and AZERTY, and switch to that one instead. Here's what you need to know.

## How to Add a Keyboard Layout in Windows 11

 Multiple keyboard layouts are already installed for your preferred language. To add them to it, follow the steps below:

1. Press **Win + I** to open Settings, and then head to **Time & language > Language & Region**.
2. Click the three-dot icon next to your preferred language (the one on top) and select **Language Options**.

3. In the **Keyboards** section, click **Add a Keyboard**, and select a different keyboard key layout from the available options.

 You can get more keyboard layouts by adding a new language. However, this requires the internet to download the new language. So, [make sure you're connected to the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-connect-to-wifi/), and follow the steps below:

1. On the **Language & Region** page in Settings (step #1 above), click **Add a Language**.
2. In the pop-up, select the language you want to install and click **Next**.

3. Click **Install** for Windows 11 to download and install the new language.
4. Follow steps #2 and #3 above to add a new keyboard layout to the language you just installed.

 If you still can't find a keyboard layout you like, you should consider [creating a custom keyboard layout](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-custom-keyboard-layout-windows/).

## How to Change a Keyboard Layout in Windows 11

 To change the keyboard layout, click the **language switcher** in the system tray section and select a different layout from there.

You don't have to be stuck with the default layout if it doesn't serve your needs. Furthermore, the layouts are flexible, and can be used on a physical keyboard or the [on-screen touch keyboard](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-enable-customize-touch-keyboard/).

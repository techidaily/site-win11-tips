 The second iteration of the [XPS 13 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-9320-Touchscreen-Notebook-Board/dp/B0CFQ5NDBH?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU37344&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-windows-pc-laptop%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) enhances its performance on the previous generation with an upgraded CPU and faster RAM. The adventurous design, with its invisible touchpad, edge-to-edge, flat keyboard, and touch-sensitive Function row, is now complemented by a stunning 3.5K (3456 x 2160) OLED display. This display offers all the OLED excellence you would expect, showcasing inky black levels, brilliant whites, and vivid, natural colors.

 You also get improved battery life, although this still struggles compared to other ultraportable laptops. Regarding portability, the XPS 13 Plus is comparable to the [13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air](https://www.makeuseof.com/m2-macbook-air-review/), with similar weight and dimensions. The similarities extend to the two USB-C/T4 ports, and the invisible touchpad offers a similar haptic response as opposed to physical clicks.

 For such an affordable laptop, the [Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Flex-5-2023-Touchscreen/dp/B0BWSG8VDK?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU37344&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-windows-pc-laptop%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers a surprisingly powerful performance.

 Furthermore, the Flex 5 sports plenty of ports. Welcome additions among them include a headphone jack and an SD card reader. However, there may be better choices for watching media content, as the screen is on the dim side, and color and contrast are a little muted.

 The [Razer Blade 16](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/119570/642901/10229?subId1=UUmuoUeUpU37344&subId2=emuo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-0483REH3-R3U1) not only offers gamers raw power, but it’s also one of the sleekest-looking gaming laptops available today. It’s a highly configurable machine, with various high-performance RTX 40-series GPUs on offer, from the RTX 4060 to the RTX 4090\. However, the 4060 and 4070 versions should deliver plenty of drive for just about any video game and are significantly more affordable.

 You can even opt for more screen real estate with a colossal [18-inch version](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Blade-Gaming-Laptop-4080-13th/dp/B0BSRHK9W7?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU37344&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-windows-pc-laptop%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that is bound to enthrall gamers seeking the ultimate immersive experience.

 All versions feature a formidable 13th Gen Intel Core i9 HX processor, while the RTX 4060 version boasts a QHD+ 240Hz display. Moving up a notch, the more powerful configurations unleash their dual-mode mini LED technology. It allows serious gamers, multitaskers, and content creators to switch between resolutions and refresh rates for unmatched versatility.

Sleek and powerful, the Razer Blade 16 is a top choice for gamers. There are several options for button bashers, with the baseline RTX 4060 model being a powerful enough machine for most. However, if you are a creative professional, such as an architect or graphic designer, the (even) more powerful versions are ideal for resource-intensive tasks.

**Pros**

* Ultra-Compact GaN Charger
* Stunning display
* Plethora of ports and slots, including HDMI 2.1
* Fast refresh rates
* Expandable memory and storage

## FAQ

### Q: What is the difference between a Windows laptop and a Chromebook?

 Windows laptops run on the Microsoft Windows operating system. Chromebooks, on the other hand, are designed for Google’s Chrome OS, a more streamlined operating system that focuses more on the essentials and relies heavily on cloud services. [Choosing between a Chromebook and a Windows laptop](https://www.makeuseof.com/chromebook-windows-which-laptop-buy/) depends on your personal needs.

 Windows laptops offer more power and are compatible with a wide range of popular software like Microsoft Office and the Adobe Creative Suite. Chromebooks are more budget-friendly options that are suitable for students and casual users who primarily use web applications and services, such as Google Workspace. These web-based apps rely heavily on an internet connection, stifling your ability to work when one is not available.

### Q: How much RAM does a laptop need on average?

 How much RAM you need depends on your intended purpose. For general, everyday use, 8GB is probably enough. While 8GB is usually plenty for most purposes, 16GB is the sweet spot. It's enough to run more demanding applications, handle light design work, perform video editing, and support most gaming purposes.

 Once you move into more professional realms, such as graphic design, scientific and data analysis, and software development, you might want to start thinking about 32GB. You could even consider 64GB if you need to use multiple resource-intensive apps simultaneously.

### Q: How do I clean my laptop screen and keyboard?

 To clean your screen:

* Use a soft, clean brush first. This will get rid of any loose particles, dust, and debris.
* Dampen a microfiber cloth with water (and a little isopropyl alcohol if you like). Ensure the cloth is only damp and not wet to avoid water damage during cleaning.
* Gently wipe the screen in circular motions. Start from the center and work your way out. Do not press heavily on the screen; gentle motions are sufficient, as you don’t want to cause any damage.
* Use a second microfiber cloth, a dry one this time, and wipe away any moisture still lingering on the screen.

 When cleaning the keyboard:

* Turn the laptop off for safety.
* Hold it at an angle to allow loose crumbs to fall out.
* Use a soft brush or even a vacuum cleaner with a nozzle attachment to get to the dust and debris lodged between the keys.
* Dampen a cotton swab or cloth with isopropyl alcohol or a water-based cleaning solution. Ensure it is only damp and the alcohol is not dripping, then wipe the keys and in between. If you have any particularly stubborn blots or marks, mix some mild cleaning solution with water and wipe again. Don’t be too vigorous, and again, ensure the cloth is damp only.
* Let the keyboard air dry before turning the laptop back on.

### Q: How do I connect my laptop to an external display?

 First, you need to check if you have a video output port on your laptop. This could be an HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C socket.

 You’ll then need a cable corresponding to the ports on your laptop and external display. So, if both have HDMI ports, you’ll need an HDMI to HDMI cable. If your laptop has a USB-C port and your TV sports an HDMI port, you’ll need a USB-C to HDMI cable, and so on.

 Connect the cable and turn on the display. You may need to configure the settings if you don’t immediately see your laptop screen on the external display. To do this on a Windows laptop, right-click and select “Display Settings.”

 You can choose “Extend,” where your external display acts as an extension of your laptop screen, or you can opt for “Duplicate.” Choosing the latter means your external display will mirror exactly what’s on your laptop. You can also select “Second Screen Only,” where your laptop screen will turn off with all content shifting to your external display.

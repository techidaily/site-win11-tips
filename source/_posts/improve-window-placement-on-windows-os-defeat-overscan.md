## Improve Window Placement on Windows OS: Defeat Overscan

 Is the display on your Windows computer getting cut off or extending beyond the visible screen area? This can make it difficult to read content near the edges or click on buttons and options.

 Fortunately, it’s possible to fix the overscanning or overscaling issues in Windows so that all the content is visible. This guide will walk you through the process.

## 1\. Disconnect and Reconnect the Display

 Overscanning problems on Windows can arise from a poorly connected [HDMI or DisplayPort](https://www.makeuseof.com/displayport-vs-hdmi/) cable. This can cause the screen image to appear stretched or cut off. Hence, the first thing you should do is disconnect and reconnect the display.

 Turn off your monitor or TV and unplug the HDMI or DisplayPort cable. Wait a few seconds, and then plug the cable back in. While you’re at it, ensure that both the cable's connector and the port are clean and free from any visible dust to ensure a secure connection.

## 2\. Change the Display Resolution

 Although Windows can automatically detect and adjust the resolution of a connected display, it may encounter difficulties at times. This can lead to overscanning or other display-related problems. In such cases, you can attempt to fix the issue by manually adjusting the display resolution.

 Follow these steps to continue:

1. Open the **Start menu** and click the gear-shaped icon to launch the Settings app.
2. Select the **System** tab and click on **Display**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Display resolution** to select the correct resolution from the list. If you don’t know the appropriate display resolution for your display, refer to the product manual or experiment with different options.

 When attempting this fix, some users report having their screen resolution settings appear grayed out. If such is the case for you too, check our guide on [fixing inaccessible screen resolution settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-inaccessible-screen-resolution-settings/).

## 3\. Change the Display Scale

 Opting for an incorrect display scale may result in certain desktop elements being cropped or extending beyond the visible screen area, leading to an overscaled display. To fix this, you need to adjust the display scale on Windows using the steps below:

1. Press **Win + I** to [open the Windows Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Head to **System > Display**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Scale** to select the **Recommended** value.  
![Change Display Scale on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/change-display-scale-on-windows.jpg)

 After changing the display scale, disconnect and reconnect the display and check if the issue is resolved.

## 4\. Use the Graphics Control Panel

 If adjusting the display resolution and scale via the Windows Settings app proves ineffective, you can try using the built-in graphics control panel to apply the changes. The exact steps will vary depending on whether your PC is equipped with Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD graphics.

 Here's how you can use the graphics control panels for each type:

## 5\. Adjust Your Monitor’s Display Settings

 Most modern monitors include settings that let you customize display parameters like resolution, aspect ratio, scaling, and more. You can access the On-Screen Display (OSD) menu using the physical buttons or a remote.

 Look for settings such as "Auto Adjust," "Screen Fit," "1:1," or "Scaling" on the menu. Experiment with different options and see if they help resolve overscanning or overscaling issues on your Windows PC.

2. Select **Bluetooth & devices** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on **Printers & scanners**.

## 2\. Edit the Relevant Registry Files

 If the default printer keeps changing even after you disable the **Let Windows manage my default printer** option, you will need to edit the registry files in order to fix the issue.

 Making incorrect changes to registry files can cause irreversible damage to your computer. Hence, it is important to follow the steps carefully and create a backup of all registry files before proceeding. If you need help with that, refer to our guide on how to [back up and restore the Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/).

 Once you have done that, use these steps to edit the registry files:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **registry editor** in the search box and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. In the Registry Editor window, use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows NT > CurrentVersion > Windows**.
5. In the right pane, double-click the **LegacyDefaultPrinterMode** key to edit it.
6. Enter **1** in the **Value data** field and click **OK**.

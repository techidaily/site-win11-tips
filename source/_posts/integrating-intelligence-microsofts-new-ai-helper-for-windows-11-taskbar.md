## Integrating Intelligence: Microsoft's New AI Helper for Windows 11 Taskbar

 Microsoft has already introduced AI Copilot to many apps and services to make users more productive. Despite Microsoft's recent push to make AI ubiquitous across all its services and platforms, an AI Copilot is still missing from one of the company's major "cash cow" products: Windows.

 Luckily, this is changing with Copilot for Windows 11\.

 As detailed in [a post on the Windows Developer Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/), Microsoft announced an AI-powered Windows Copilot for Windows 11 at the Build 2023 developer conference to help you with pretty much everything on the operating system. Windows Copilot is essentially a chat box that Windows 11 users can access from the taskbar.

 You can ask the Copilot to find and tweak something in Windows 11 Settings, and it will do that in the blink of an eye. Not only that, but it can also analyze what's going on on your PC screen and suggests actions accordingly. For example, it can organize app windows to display multiple apps side by side to help you with multitasking. And all of this is possible because Windows Copilot is built into the OS.

 Since Windows Copilot supports Bing Chat and ChatGPT plugins, it can also search the web. This way, Windows Copilot eliminates the need to launch a web browser for casual browsing. Windows Copilot can also summarize a lengthy document, like Bing Copilot in Edge and Bing Chat. Microsoft has posted a video, which you can watch below, giving us a glimpse of some of the core features of Windows Copilot.

## Microsoft Will Bring Windows Copilot to Windows 11 Soon

 Microsoft has officially confirmed that Windows Copilot will be available as a preview on Windows 11 Insider builds first. The Redmond tech giant will start rolling out the AI Copilot feature next month, in June. However, which Windows Insider Channel will get the functionality first remains unclear. It will likely be available for Canary or Dev Channel Insiders first ([what is the Windows Canary Channel?](http://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-windows-insider-canary-channel/)). But if you're the usual Windows 11 Stable user, you can expect to see it on your PC by the end of this year.

## Windows Copilot Will Help You Do Things Faster on Windows 11

 Windows 11 with Windows Copilot will help you get things done faster. Those new to Windows 11 will no longer have to scratch their heads trying to find the settings they want to tweak, as the AI Copilot can help them with that. However, all these benefits come at the expense of privacy risks because the Windows Copilot will likely collect your usage data.

 Luckily, this is changing with Copilot for Windows 11\.

 Once you restart your computer, Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be installed and ready to use. In case you want to uninstall the Application Guard, you can do so by using the same command prompt steps. Just make sure to run the following command instead:

3. Now press**Enter** on your keyboard to execute it.

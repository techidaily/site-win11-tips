## 3\. How to Enable or Disable Windows Spotlight Images With the Registry Editor

 Registry Editor in Windows provides yet another way to enable or disable spotlight images on the lock screen. However, this method may not be suitable for everyone, especially those who are not familiar with the Registry Editor.

2. Type**regedit** in the text box and press**Enter** to open the Registry Editor.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > Software > Policies > Microsoft > Windows > CloudContent** .
5. Right-click on the**CloudContent** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Rename the DWORD to**DisableWindowsSpotlightFeatures** .
6. Double-click on the newly created DWORD to edit it.
7. Enter**1** in the Value data field to disable spotlight images. If you want to enable them, enter**0** instead.
8. Click**OK** .

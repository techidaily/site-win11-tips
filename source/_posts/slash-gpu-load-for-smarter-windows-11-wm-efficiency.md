 To disable HDR in Windows 11, open Settings, select System from the left sidebar, and then select Display from the right pane. Then, disable the toggle switch next to **Use HDR**.

![Use HDR option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/use-hdr.jpg)

 After that, your display will momentarily go blank. Subsequently, you'll observe a shift in display color, indicating that you've successfully disabled HDR.

## 6\. Optimize Your Visual Effect Settings

 As aforementioned, the Desktop Window Manager oversees the visual aspects of your computer's interface. But, if your computer's visual effects settings are not correctly configured, the Desktop Window Manager might consume a significant amount of GPU resources.

 To resolve this, you must optimize your computer's visual effects settings. Here's how you can do it:

1. Press the **Win + R** hotkey to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **sysdm.cpl ,3** into the search bar and press **Enter**.  
![Advanced system settings code in the Run dialog box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/advanced-system-settings-code.jpg)

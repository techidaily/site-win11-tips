## Hasty Help for Defining Windows Vocabulary

 Searching for definitions on a computer is far easier and quicker than looking for definitions in printed dictionaries. However, Windows 11 does not have a built-in dictionary app to help you find the meanings of words you do not know.

 On the bright side, Windows 11 offers you multiple quick ways to look up definitions without hassle. To help you save time and increase your productivity, we are putting together a list of three easy ways to find definitions on Windows 11.

## 1\. Get Definitions in Microsoft Edge

 Whether you are reading web pages or PDFs, one of[Microsoft Edge's best hidden features](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-hidden-features-in-microsoft-edge/) is its built-in dictionary functionality to quickly find the correct meanings for unknown words. To make it more convenient, Edge will not take you to another tab to display the definitions, thus helping you stay focused on whatever you are reading.

These are the steps to use the dictionary in Microsoft Edge:

1. Select the word that is unknown to you and leave your mouse cursor.
2. The Mini menu now appears on your screen, containing several options.
3. Look for the**Define** option, and click on it.

 Edge will now show a popup containing the different meanings of that word. However, if you do not like the Mini menu, the browser's right-click context menu also includes the**Define** option. You can get definitions of words from the context menu, too.

## 2\. Find Definitions in the Windows 11 Search Box

 Windows 11 search box can come in handy to find meanings of words, mainly when you see an unknown word in a document in printed form. In that case, it is super convenient to use the search box instead of opening a printed dictionary.

Here's how:

1. Click on the search box in Windows 11 taskbar.
2. Type "define" followed by the word you do not know the meaning of.
3. Press**Enter** on your keyboard to display the results instantly.

## Finding Definitions in Windows 11

 The solutions above will not require you to install any third-party application. The Microsoft Edge browser and the Cortana app come pre-installed with Windows 11, so when you turn on your PC, it will not be difficult to find them. The search box is also enabled by default.

 However, if you prefer third-party tools to native solutions, they are available to help you look up definitions in Windows 11.

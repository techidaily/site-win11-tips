### 2\. Reset the Graphics Card Driver Using Device Manager

 If you are still facing display issues even after applying the keyboard shortcut to refresh your graphics card driver, you can try resetting it with the Device Manager.

1. First,[open the Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) by searching for it in the Windows search box and clicking on the**Device Manager** icon from the Start menu**.**

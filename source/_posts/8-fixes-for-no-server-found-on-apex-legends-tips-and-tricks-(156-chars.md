## 8 Fixes for 'No Server Found' On Apex Legends: Tips and Tricks (<156 Chars)

 Apex Legends is one of Windows's most popular Battle Royale Hero shooter games. But like any other online game, it can run into issues from time to time. One of the popular Apex Legends problems is the "no server found" error code.

 The error indicates that there's an issue in connecting with the game servers. So, if you also encounter the same problem, consider trying the below solutions.

## What Triggers the "No Server Found" Error in Apex Legends?

 One of the instances in which the error code can appear is when the game servers are currently facing downtime. But there are many more reasons that can be responsible for the issue. Let's check them out first before driving into the solutions.

1. Running the game without administrative rights is one of the most prominant reasons why Apex Legends can't find any servers.
2. Some outdated or corrupt network adapters can affect your connectivity and cause the problem at hand.
3. A corrupt DNS cache data is another reason Apex Legends cannot connect with the servers.

Now let's check out all the solutions in detail.

## 1\. Check the Apex Legends Server Status
![Apex Legends Server status webpage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apex-Legends-Server-Page.jpg)

 Like any other online multiplayer game, Apex Legends servers can face downtime. If the game is experiencing an outage or maintenance, you'll be unable to connect to them.

 So, whenever you face the problem at hand, first check the server status of the game. You can do this by visiting the [Apex Legends server-status checking webpage](https://apexlegendsstatus.com/) .

## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Most of server connection-related issues in online multiplayer games often result from a weak internet connection. So, check the internet connection whenever you face the problem at hand. You can do it by visiting one of the [internet-speed checking websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) .

 If you are getting a comparatively lower speed, consider power cycling the router. If that doesn't help, contact your ISP.

 Another quick way to resolve the issue is to switch to a different server within your region. However, this fix will only be helpful if there's a regional server outage. If all the servers are down, then try the next solution.

 Also, be prepared to experience comparatively higher ping on the new server, but it's still better than waiting for the servers to become operational again.

## 5\. Verify Games Files

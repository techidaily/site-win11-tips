## Addressing Spooler Service Error on Windows Systems

 The Print Spooler is a little application built into your operating system. It allows you to send multiple print jobs to a queue without waiting for the initial print job to complete. If the print spooler service stops working, you’ll encounter the print spooler service is not running error on Windows.

 It is a common error associated with print jobs. However, the reasons for the error can vary. You may encounter this error when setting up a new printer, after installing an update, or upgrading your router. In any case, here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this error in Windows.

## How "The Print Spooler Service Is Not Running” Error Message Appears

 Here are the different types of print spooler errors you can encounter:

* "Windows cannot connect to the printer. The local print spooler service is not running."
* "Operation could not be completed. The print spooler service is not running."

 Whichever error you encounter, the solutions for fixing them are the same.

![delete printer spooler service files](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-printer-spooler-service-files.jpg)

 Now create a new print job and check if the error is resolved. If not, disconnect and reconnect the printer to see if that helps.

## 5\. Check Windows Defender Firewall

 If your printer is connected to a network, it is possible that Windows Defender Firewall is preventing the connection resulting in the error. You can confirm this case by [temporarily disabling Windows Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-windows-security-windows-11/) and creating a new print job.

 To disable Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Privacy & security** tab in the left pane.
3. Next, click on **Windows Security.**  
![Open Windows Security Windows 11 Settings 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Open-Windows-Security-Windows-11-Settings-1.jpg)
4. Finally, click on **Open Windows Security.**

![firewall and network protection windows defender](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/firewall-and-network-protection-windows-defender.jpg)
6. Click on your currently active network **(Public / Private).**
7. Toggle the switch under **Microsoft Defender Firewall** to turn off **Firewall**. Click **Yes** if prompted by **UAC**.  
![turn off Microsoft defender firewall](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/turn-off-Microsoft-defender-firewall.jpg)

9. Once done, enable the **Windows Defender Firewall** protection.

 If you use your printer frequently, disabling Windows Defender Firewall is not a feasible solution. You’ll need to investigate the issue further to allow the connection through the Firewall.

 Outdated or corrupted [computer drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/computer-drivers-what-are-they-why-should-you-update/) can cause your connected device to malfunction.

2. Type **devmgmt.msc** and click **OK** to open **Device Manager.**
3. In Device Manager, expand the **Print queues** section.
4. Right-click on your printer and select **Update driver.**
5. Next, select **Search automatically for drivers**. Windows will scan for a new driver update and download and install it if available.

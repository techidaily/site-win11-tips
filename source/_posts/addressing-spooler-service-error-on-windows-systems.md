## Addressing Spooler Service Error on Windows Systems

 The Print Spooler is a little application built into your operating system. It allows you to send multiple print jobs to a queue without waiting for the initial print job to complete. If the print spooler service stops working, you’ll encounter the print spooler service is not running error on Windows.

 It is a common error associated with print jobs. However, the reasons for the error can vary. You may encounter this error when setting up a new printer, after installing an update, or upgrading your router. In any case, here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this error in Windows.

## How "The Print Spooler Service Is Not Running” Error Message Appears

 Here are the different types of print spooler errors you can encounter:

* "Windows cannot connect to the printer. The local print spooler service is not running."
* "Operation could not be completed. The print spooler service is not running."

 Whichever error you encounter, the solutions for fixing them are the same.

## 1\. Run the Printer Troubleshooter

 The built-in Printer troubleshooter in Windows 10 and 11 lets you [find and fix printing problems](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-printer-not-working/). The troubleshooter scans the system for common print problems and automatically resolves them. It can check and restart the print spooler service if stopped.

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **System** tab in the left pane.
3. In the right pane, scroll down and click on **Troubleshoot**.

## 5\. Check Windows Defender Firewall

 If your printer is connected to a network, it is possible that Windows Defender Firewall is preventing the connection resulting in the error. You can confirm this case by [temporarily disabling Windows Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-windows-security-windows-11/) and creating a new print job.

 To disable Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Privacy & security** tab in the left pane.
3. Next, click on **Windows Security.**  
![Open Windows Security Windows 11 Settings 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Open-Windows-Security-Windows-11-Settings-1.jpg)
4. Finally, click on **Open Windows Security.**
5. Open the **Firewall & network protection** tab in the left pane.  
![firewall and network protection windows defender](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/firewall-and-network-protection-windows-defender.jpg)
6. Click on your currently active network **(Public / Private).**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

9. Once done, enable the **Windows Defender Firewall** protection.

 If you use your printer frequently, disabling Windows Defender Firewall is not a feasible solution. You’ll need to investigate the issue further to allow the connection through the Firewall.

## 3\. Clean Up Your Disk Drive

 Your computer must have enough space to download and install the Windows updates. If this isn't the case, you will likely face different issues, including the update error 0x800f0922.

 The solution, in this case, is to [free up disk space in your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-free-disk-space-windows-10/) . One way to do that is by cleaning the drive containing the Windows 11 OS, which is C: drive for most users.

2. Click the drop-down icon, select the drive containing Windows 11 OS, and then click**OK.**

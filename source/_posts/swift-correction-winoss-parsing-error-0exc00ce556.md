## 2\. Replace a Corrupted Machine.config File

 The most common cause of error 0xC00CE556 is a corrupted machine.config file cited in the parsing error message.

1. First, click the taskbar button (or folder library icon) to open File Explorer.
2. Open the Config folder by inputting this path in Explorer's directory address bar and pressing**Enter** :  
`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config`
3. Right-click the**machine.config** file and select the**Delete** (trash bin) option to erase it.

4. Next, right-click the**machine.config.default** file and select the context menu's**Rename** option.

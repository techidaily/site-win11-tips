## Quick Outlook Responses: A Windows Fix Guide

 With Microsoft Outlook, you can easily manage your emails, calendar, contacts, and tasks from one app. If you rely on Microsoft Outlook for work or personal communication, it can be frustrating when the app runs slowly on your Windows computer.

 Before you give up and switch to an alternative, try out the following tips to boost Outlook’s performance on Windows.

## 1\. Modify Outlook's Send and Receive Settings

 By default, Outlook is set to send/receive emails every 30 minutes. Setting a longer interval for automatic send/receive in Outlook can help improve the app's performance as it would need to consume system resources less frequently.

1. In the Outlook app, click the **File** menu in the top left corner.
2. Select **Options** from the left sidebar.
3. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab.
4. Under the **Send and receive** section, click the **Send/Receive** button.
5. Tick the **Schedule an automatic send/receive every** checkbox and enter the desired refresh interval in the box next to it.

## 2\. Avoid Syncing RSS Feeds

 Outlook periodically checks the RSS feeds you have subscribed to in order to download new content. If you are syncing too many RSS feeds into Outlook, it may adversely impact its performance on Windows. If you don't want that, use these steps to disable RSS feed sync in Outlook.

1. In the Outlook app, click the **File** menu in the top left corner.
2. Select **Options** from the left sidebar.
3. Switch to the **Advanced** tab.
4. Under the **RSS Feeds** section, clear both check boxes.
5. Click **OK**.

## 3\. Compact Outlook's PST files

 On Windows, Outlook creates PST (or Personal Storage Table) files to store your emails, attachments, calendar data, and other information. If these PST files become too large, they can negatively impact Outlook's performance on Windows, causing it to run slowly. You can try reducing the size of Outlook data files to see if that improves the situation.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **control** in the box and press **Enter** to open Control Panel.
3. Use the **View by** drop-down menu in the top right corner to select **Large icons**.
4. Click on **Mail (Microsoft Outlook)**.
5. Click the **Data Files** button.
6. Select your Outlook data file and click the **Settings** option.
7. Click the **Compact Now** button.

## 4\. Check the Outlook Indexing Status

 By default, Windows Search indexes all the data contained within Outlook OST and PST files. If Windows is in the process of indexing Outlook files, the app may experience lag during that time. To check the indexing status of Outlook data files, follow these steps:

1. In the Outlook app, navigate to **File > Options**.
2. Switch to the **Search** tab and click on **Indexing Options**.
3. Check the indexing status in the Indexing Options window.  
![Outlook Indexing Status](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/outlook-indexing-status.jpg)

 It’s important to note that Windows only indexes Outlook data when the Outlook app is open. So, if Windows is indexing Outlook files, leave the app open until the process is complete. Following this, Outlook should run smoothly on Windows.

## 5\. Disable Unwanted Add-Ins

 Although third-party add-ins help [improve your Outlook workflow](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-best-practices-outlook-boost-workflow/) in many ways, they can also cause the app to operate slowly, especially if you are using too many of them. To avoid this, it’s best to disable or remove any non-essential add-ins from Outlook. Here are the steps for the same.

1. In the Outlook app, click the **File** menu at the top.
2. Select **Options** from the left pane.
3. In the Outlook Options window, switch to the **Add-ins** tab.
4. Click the **Go** button next to **COM Add-ins**.
5. Clear all the checkboxes to disable your add-ins. Alternatively, you can use the **Remove** button to uninstall add-ins.
6. Click **OK** to save changes.

## 6\. Disable Redirection of the AppData Directory

 Another reason why Outlook may run slowly is if the AppData folder is being redirected to a network location. To avoid issues caused by a slow network, you can disable the redirection of the AppData directory. Since this process involves editing registry files, make sure you [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding.

1. Use one of the many ways to [open the Registry Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/).
2. Navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > Software > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Explorer > User Shell Folders**.
3. Locate the **AppData** entry in the right pane and double-click it.
4. Enter **%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming** in the Value data field and click **OK**.

## Revitalizing Your PC's DNS with Ease in Windows 11

 Facing internet connectivity issues on your Windows PC? DNS cache corruption is among the most common reasons for connectivity problems. The quickest fix for this problem is to flush the DNS cache and force the computer to recreate it.

 But do you know that there are multiple ways to flush the DNS cache on Windows 11? We will elaborate on the benefits of clearing the DNS cache along with the multiple methods which you can use on your Windows 11 PC. Without further ado, let’s dive into the post.

## What Is the DNS Cache and Why Should You Flush It?

 When you access a website, you usually do so by typing its URL in a browser. However, computers don't "understand" URLs, and each URL has a corresponding IP address that a computer can actually use. When you search for a website, your computer accesses a DNS server that contains records of URLs and their corresponding IP addresses.

 This process is known as DNS lookup, but it is time-consuming to search for an IP address every time, especially for websites that you visit repeatedly. So, the computer maintains a local copy of the DNS known as the DNS resolver cache. When you search for a URL, it checks the resolver cache first and then uses that information to find the website.

 The DNS resolver cache can become outdated or corrupt over time which can pose connectivity issues. There is also a looming risk of [DNS cache poisoning](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-dns-cache-poisoning/) , which is why you should make it a habit to clean the DNS cache periodically.

## How to Flush the DNS Cache on Windows 11

 There are multiple methods to flush the DNS cache on Windows 11\. You can use the Run command box, Command Prompt, or even PowerShell. In addition, you can use a batch file to clear the DNS cache in a few clicks, any time you want. Here are the four ways to clear DNS on Windows 11:

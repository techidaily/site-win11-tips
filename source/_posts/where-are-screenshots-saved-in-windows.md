## Where Do Screenshots Go on Windows 10 and 11?

 There are several built-in tools for [taking screenshots on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/take-screenshot-windows-11/), including the Print Screen key (typically abbreviated **Prt Sc** on your keyboard) and Snipping Tool. Depending on which one you use, you might have to save it yourself after taking it, or navigate to a specific folder to grab it.

### Prt Sc Key

 Where do print screens go? The answer is simple: to the clipboard. If you want to access the screenshot, you have to save the it manually in an image editor like Paint. You can even paste the screenshots into programs that allow you to insert images, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

### Windows Key + Prt Sc

 When you use the **Win + Prt Sc** shortcut, the screenshot goes to the clipboard. Windows also saves it on your computer; you can access it by heading to **Pictures > Screenshots** in File Explorer.

![The Screenshots folder on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshots-folder-windows.jpg)

 The screenshot will be saved in PNG format with a generic name like "Screenshot (2)."

### Snipping Tool (Windows Key + Shift + S)

 If you're [using the Snipping Tool instead of Prt Sc](https://www.makeuseof.com/snipping-tool-vs-printscreen-windows/), you will find the screenshot in the **Pictures > Screenshots** folder. You'll also be able to find it on the clipboard.

 When you take the screenshot using the Snipping tool, a pop-up will appear in the bottom-right corner. When you click it, it will open a preview and edit window, and you can choose where to save the screenshot. To do so, click the save icon in the top-right corner or press **Ctrl + S**, then select a different location.

![The Snipping Tool on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/snipping-tool-windows-11.jpg)

 Make sure you select a location you can easily remember so you don't forget where you placed it.

### Xbox Game Bar (Windows Key + G)

 You can find where the Xbox Game Bar saves your screenshots by heading to **This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Users > \[your username\] > Videos > Captures**.

![The Captures folder highlighted in the Videos folder on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/captures-folder-windows.jpg)

 In the file path, replace **\[your username\]** with the name of the user account you've logged into. That means if the account username is Jack, then the file path will be **This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Users > Jack > Videos > Captures**.

 You can also find out where the screenshots go from the Game Bar. Press **Win + G** to open the app, then click **Capture**—the camera icon—in the widget. In the **Capture** widget, click **See My Captures**.

 In the pop-up, click **Continue**, and it will open the folder with the screenshots.

## Where Do Windows Screenshots Go When Using Third-Party Tools?

 When using third-party screenshot tools like Snagit, Lightshot, or ShareX, the app will usually decide where to save the screenshots. When you take a screenshot, a preview might pop up in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Click this may take you to the folder where you'll find the screenshot (or in some cases, clicking will open it for editing).

 Apps like Snagit open a preview window instead, allowing you to choose where to save the screenshot. You can also try checking the app's menus and settings to see if you can find the location of screenshots there. For example, you can find out where Steam saves screenshots by opening the app and clicking **File > Screenshots**.

![Navigating to the Screenshots folder in Steam](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/steam-view-screenshots.jpg)

 If you can't figure out where the app saved the screenshots, open File Explorer and check the **Pictures** and **Documents** folders. For instance, Lightshot saves the screenshots in **Documents > Lightshot**.

## Can You Change Where Screenshots Are Saved on Windows?

 Yes, you can easily [change the location where Windows saves screenshots](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-screenshot-location-change/) for the built-in tools. For third-party tools, you can look in their settings to see if they allow you to change the default save location.

## What to Do if You Can't Find Your Screenshots

 If you've just taken a screenshot and don't know where it is, you should check the clipboard. You can do this by pressing **Ctrl + V** with your cursor focused in a window that will accept pasted images. If your screenshot appears, paste it into a compatible program and manually save it.

 Also, you can open File Explorer and check the **Recent** section for the screenshot.

![A screenshot in the Recent section of the File Explorer Home tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/file-explorer-home-recent.jpg)

 Another thing you can do, on top of looking in the **Pictures** and **Documents** folders, is [check the installation location of the program](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-find-programs-install-location/) you use for screenshots. Look for folders with names like **Screenshots** or **Captures**. Using Windows Search for these common terms could help you locate them.

 Once you find the folder where the screenshots are, you may wish to note the file path in the Sticky Notes app. Alternatively, you can right-click the folder and select **Pin to Quick Access**. This will make it easier to remember where your Windows screenshots go.

However, if you are using the Home edition, you can use a workaround to [access the Local Group Policy Editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Control Panel > Personalization**.
5. Double-click the **Enable Screen Saver** policy on your right.
6. Select the **Enabled** option.
7. Hit **Apply** and then click **OK**.
8. Similarly, enable the **Password protect the screen saver** policy as well.

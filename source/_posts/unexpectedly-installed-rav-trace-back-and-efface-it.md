## Unexpectedly Installed Rav? Trace Back & Efface It

 If you have RAV Antivirus running on your computer but don't remember installing it, it may have been installed along with another application. It sometimes gets bundled in with other apps, and you are more likely to experience this if you download a torrenting app.

 While RAV antivirus isn't bad by any means, sometimes you will accidentally install it without wanting it. Thus, if it's now on your computer and now you want to uninstall it, here's how.

## How to Remove RAV Antivirus on Windows

Follow the below steps to remove RAV Antivirus on Windows:

1. Right-click on the Windows**Start** button and select**Settings** .
2. On the left-sidebar, click**Apps** .
3. Click**Apps & Features** in the right-hand pane.
4. Under**App list** , search for**"RAV Antivirus."**
5. To uninstall the program, right-click on the**three vertical dots** next to its name and select**Uninstall** .

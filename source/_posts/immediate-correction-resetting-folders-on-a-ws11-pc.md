## Immediate Correction: Resetting Folders on a WS11 PC

 Users widely report Windows 11 update errors on support forums. Updates fail to install because of such errors. You can often fix update errors by resetting the catroot 2 and Windows SoftwareDistribution folders as covered below.

## What Are the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 Folders?

 The SoftwareDistribution folder is a directory that stores files required for installing Windows updates on PCs. It is a temporary repository of the update files. Thus, the SoftwareDistribution folder is an important component for updating Windows.

 Catroot 2 is a folder that stores the signature data for Windows 11 updates. Those are the files the Cryptographic service needs for update verification.

 Both folders contain files needed for the installation of Windows updates. Windows update installation issues can occur because of corrupted data in those folders. Those errors typically appear in Settings with variable codes like 0x800f0922 when users manually select to check for and install updates.

 Therefore, resetting those folders is a troubleshooting method for fixing Windows 11 update installation issues. Resetting the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folders removes corrupted data they might contain, which rebuilds them. You can reset those folders by deleting their contents or renaming them.

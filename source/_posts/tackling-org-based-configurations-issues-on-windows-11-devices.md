## What Causes This Error Message to Appear?

 The error generally appears on your computer screen whenever you attempt to make changes to the Settings app. This can cause an unwanted hindrance, as it will not allow you to make changes in your Settings menu. It can occur due to several reasons:

1. You might be using a company or school-managed account.
2. Viruses and malware may restrict access to system settings.
3. You have installed third-party programs that interfere with Windows settings.

Let's now see how to fix this problem.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 The first thing to fix the "some settings are managed by your organization" error is to restart your computer. This will resolve any temporary glitches. If you need help, check out[the different ways to restart a Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) .

 Your computer will then start to reboot and hopefully, your Settings app will now be free from any restrictions.

## 2\. Check for Windows Updates

 If restarting your computer doesn't do the trick, make sure you've got the latest Windows updates installed on your computer. Microsoft routinely rolls out updates that could potentially address quite a few problems with its operating system. So, it is advised to search for any pending Windows Updates as another potential solution.

 Usually, restart your computer to complete the installation process. Then check to see if you can now make changes in your Settings app.

## 3\. Uninstall the Third-Party Application

 If you've recently added any third-party application installed on your Windows PC, it could be the cause of this issue. Uninstalling such applications can solve the problem.

 Think back to any applications you installed before the error began appearing. If you have an idea as to what might be the cause, follow our guide on[how to uninstall programs on Windows 10](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-uninstall-programs-on-windows-10/) or[Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) to get rid of it.

 Once done, restart your computer to apply the changes. If it hasn't gone away yet, try getting rid of any other recent applications.

## 4\. Change Diagnostic Data Settings

 Microsoft checks the data on your device to improve Windows and keep it up to date. If certain settings related to Diagnostics & Feedback are disabled, it could lead to this particular error getting thrown.

 o solve this, you need to adjust these settings. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Select**Privacy & security** from the left pane.
3. On the right side of the page, scroll down to**Windows permissions** and click on**Diagnostics & feedback** .  
![Send optional diagnostic data](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/send-optional-diagnostic-data.jpg)
4. If the "Send optional diagnostic data" switch is off, make sure you toggle it to**On** .

 Once you complete the above steps, close the Settings window and restart your system. See if that resolves the problem.

## 5\. Edit the Local Group Policy Editor

 In case the Settings window fails to open or is not accessible, you can enable sending additional diagnostic data through the Group Policy Editor. Before proceeding, take note that the application will only operate on Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.

 Unfortunately, if you are using the Home edition, Local Group Policy is not available on your device. To make it work, you first need to[activate the Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) .

Once you can open the Group Policy Editor, follow the below steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** from the menu list.
2. Type**gpedit.msc** in the text box and click**OK** .
3. In the Local Group Policy Editor window, navigate to the following:  
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds
4. Now move to the right pane, right-click on**Allow Diagnostic Data** , and select**Edit** from the context menu.  
![Allow Diagnostic Data Using Group Policy](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/allow-diagnostic-data-using-group-policy.jpg)  
 If your system runs Windows 10 or an earlier version, you will see**Allow Telemetry** instead of**Allow Diagnostic Data** .

6. Under the**Options** section, click the drop-down menu and select**Send optionally diagnostics data** .
7. Finally, click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.

 After you have followed all these steps, restart your computer and check if it solves the problem. If not, continue to the next solution.

## 6\. Tweak the Registry Editor

 This method is a bit more advanced and should be done with extra caution. One wrong move and you may end up damaging your system. This is why you should[back up your Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making any changes.

1. Search for**regedit** in the Start menu and click on it to open.
2. When a UAC dialog box appears, select**Yes** to confirm your action.
3. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
4. Now go to the right side pane and look for the**Wuserver** key.  
![Edit Registry Editor to fix the error message](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/edit-registry-editor-to-fix-the-error-message.jpg)
5. Then right-click on it and choose**Delete** from the context menu.

6. If a pop-up menu appears on the screen, click**Yes** to confirm.

 Once you have made these changes, close the Registry editor window and restart your computer. Next time you start your PC, the error message will be gone.

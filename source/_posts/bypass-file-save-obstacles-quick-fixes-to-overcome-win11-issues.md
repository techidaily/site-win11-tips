## 4\. Remove Problematic Objects From the Slide

 An unsupported object in your presentation can also prevent you from saving the file. In this case, you'll need to go through each slide in your presentation and look for the problematic object.

 To find the problematic object, copy all inserted objects and paste them into a new slide. The object that is [failing to copy and paste](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-copy-paste-not-working/) into the new slide is the culprit.

 Remove that object from your presentation, and then try to save the file. If you still get the error, continue with the guide.

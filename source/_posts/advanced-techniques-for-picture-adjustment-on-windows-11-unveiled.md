## Advanced Techniques for Picture Adjustment on Windows 11 Unveiled

 Users often need to resize images to fit them better on websites, blogs, documents, or even within frames for printed output. Almost every general image-editing app for Windows has options for resizing pictures. Windows 11 also includes pre-installed apps you can utilize for resizing images to more ideal dimensions.

 Here are some ways to resize images in Windows 11 with its pre-installed Microsoft apps and some third-party software alternatives.

## 1\. How to Resize Images With Photos

 Photos is primarily a default image viewer app that comes with Windows 11, but it does include some basic editing options. You can use that app to resize your images in pixels and percentage terms. These are the steps for resizing pictures with Photos:

1. Open Photos by clicking Windows 11’s Start button and selecting that app’s pinned menu shortcut.
2. Click**All Photos** to view your images.  
![The All Photos button in Microsoft Phots](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/photos-app.jpg)
3. Right-click an image for resizing and select**Open** .
4. Click the**See more** (ellipses) button in the editing window that opens.
5. Select the**Resize image** option.  
![The Resize image option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-resize-image-option.jpg)
6. Select the**Pixels** option.
7. Then input different pixel values in the**Width** and**Height** boxes. If you only modify one value, the other one will be automatically proportionally changed to retain the same aspect ratio.

8. Click**Save** to apply the resize.

 Users who select the alternative**Percentage** option need to enter percentage values in the**Width** and**Height** boxes. Entering values like 80 and 90 will reduce the size of the image by 20 and 10 percent. Inputting higher numbers like 110 and 120 will increase the image’s size by 10 and 20 percent. Thus, the percentage size change amounts to how much the values are above or below 100.

 The**Resize** box in Photos also includes a**Quality** bar setting. However, you can only use that setting for JPG output. Select the .**jpg** option in the**File extensio** n drop-down menu. Then drag the bar’s slider left or right to set the picture quality in the resized image.

## 2\. How to Resize Images With Paint

 Microsoft Paint is the raster graphics app bundled with Windows 11\. It’s a relatively basic drawing and image-editing software compared with the likes of PhotoShop. However, utilizing Paint is fine for basic stuff like resizing and cropping images. Our [Paint guide to resizing and cropping images](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-resize-crop-image-microsoft-paint/) includes full instructions for how you can change your images’ dimensions with that app.

## 3\. How to Resize Images With Paint 3D

1. Paint 3D isn’t a pre-installed Windows 11 app. If you don’t have that app, open the [Paint 3D](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/paint-3d/9NBLGGH5FV99) page on the Microsoft Store website.
2. Click**Get** **in Store** app on the Paint 3D app page.

6. Click the**Resize image** with canvas checkbox to select that option.
7. Now left-click a corner of the image, hold the mouse button, and drag the mouse cursor left/right to reduce or expand the picture. The values in the**Height** and**Width** boxes change as you drag the mouse.
8. When you’re done resizing, click the**Menu** button.
9. Select the**Save** option. Or you can select**Save as** if you prefer not to overwrite the original file.

 You can also enter different values in the**Width** and**Height** boxes to resize the image. Select**Pixels** or**Percentage** on the drop-down menu to change the value type. Deselect the**Lock aspect ratio** option if you don’t want to retain the image’s proportions.

## 4\. How to Resize Images With Edge

7. Click**Fill with image dimensions** for the**Resize** option to see the current values for the selected picture in the**Width** and**Height** boxes.

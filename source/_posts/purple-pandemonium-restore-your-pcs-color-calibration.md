## 3\. Disable the Color Filters

 The "desktop color" issue might also be caused by the way you’ve configured the color filters on your device.

In this instance, here’s how you can resolve the problem:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Click**Ease of Access** from the menu items.
3. Click**Color filters** on the left-hand side.

## 4\. Configure the Night Light Settings

 In some cases, the issue might be caused by the way you've configured the night light settings.

 When you turn on the Windows night light settings, your PC displays warmer colors to help you sleep. If you've enabled these settings, it’s highly likely that they're the reason you're experiencing the "desktop color" issue.

To get rid of the problem, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Select**System** from the menu items.
3. Click**Display** on the left-hand side pane.
4. Turn off the**Night light** button on the right-hand side.

Let’s first check out how you can update the display drivers:

## 8\. Use a System Restore Point

 Did you start experiencing the “desktop color” issue recently? If so, then you could tackle the problem by using a system restore point.

 If you have an existing restore point on your PC, here’s how you can use it to tackle the issue at hand:

1. Type**Create a Restore Point** in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Navigate to the**System Protection** tab and click**System Restore** . From there, press**Next** to continue.
3. Select**Show more restore points** and then pick your preferred restore point.
4. Click**Next** , click**Finish** , and then wait for the process to complete.

## Crafting an Invisible Button on TaskView Bar

 The Task View button in the taskbar displays all open windows at once. However, not everyone prefers this button as it occupies valuable space on the taskbar.

 If you wish to remove the Task View button, you have come to the right place. Here, we will explore three methods to hide the Task View button from the Windows 11 Taskbar.

## Hide the Task View Button Using the Settings App

 The Windows Settings app is the go-to place to [customize the taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-taskbar/). Here’s how to use it to remove the Task View button from the taskbar:

1. Press the **Win + I** key to open the **Settings** **app**.
2. Choose **Personalization** from the left sidebar and **Taskbar** from the right pane.
3. Disable the toggle next to the **Task** **view** option. This will remove the Task View button from the taskbar.

## Hide the Task View Button Using the Registry Editor

 The Registry Editor allows you to modify different registries of your computer. You can use this tool to access the Task View registry and configure it to be hidden from the taskbar. ​​​​​​

 Editing the registry is risky, as one wrong edit can make your system unstable. Therefore, make sure to [back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with the steps.

 Follow these steps to hide the Task View button via the registry editor:

1. Press the **Win** **key** to open the **Start** **Menu**, type **Registry** **Editor** in the search bar, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`
3. Double-click on the **ShowTaskViewButton** value in the right pane, type **0** in the **Value** **data**, and click **OK**. This will hide the Task View button from the taskbar.

## Swiftly Recover Icon Positions in Windows 10

 Windows doesn’t have any options for saving and restoring desktop icon layouts. However, you can still save and restore different icon layouts on the desktop when needed with the DesktopOK and Relcon software packages.

 As such, let's explore both apps and find the one right for you.

## How to Save and Restore Desktop Icon Layouts With DesktopOK

 DesktopOK is an old app for saving and restoring Windows desktop icon layouts that’s still actively supported. You can utilize this software on the Windows 11/10/8/7 platforms. Aside from enabling you to manually save desktop layouts, it includes options for automatically saving desktop layouts. This is how you can save and restore a desktop icon layout with DesktopOK:

1. Open this [download page for DesktopOK](http://www.softwareok.com/?Download=DesktopOK) within a web browser.
2. Click the **DesktopOK\_Installer\_x64.zip** download link. That’s the download link for 64-bit Windows 11/10, but users with older 32-bit platforms should click DesktopOK\_Installer.zip.
3. [Go into Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) (click the library folder taskbar icon) and browse to the directory to which DesktopOK downloaded.
4. [Unzip the ZIP archive](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to extract DesktopOK to a subfolder.
5. Open DesktopOK’s extracted subfolder and double-click the **DesktopOK\_Installer\_x64**.

1. Select **English** on the Language drop-down menu.
2. Press **Install** to install DesktopOK at the default folder location.

5. Next, click the **Punch the icons** option and **Yes** to scatter the icons across the desktop.
6. Select your saved desktop icon layout and click **Restore** to return all the icons to their positions.

 DesktopOK will save your desktop icon layouts with default screen resolution titles. To enter a custom title for the saved desktop icon layout, select it in the DesktopOK window and click the ab| option. Then input a different title for the desktop icon layout. You can also erase saved layouts by selecting them in the window and clicking **Delete**.

 If you want the app to automatically save icon layouts on the desktop, you’ll need to enable that feature. Click **Options** \> **Auto-Save** to view a submenu with options for automatically saving layouts. Select **Use this feature** and a time interval option for saving the icon layouts.

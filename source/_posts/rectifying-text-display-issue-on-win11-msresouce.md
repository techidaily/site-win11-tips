## Rectifying Text Display Issue on Win11: MsResouce

 If you have performed an upgrade recently and noticed a weird "ms-resource:Appname/text" entry in the Start Menu, you are not alone. You may also encounter this error when opening a setting or app.

 This entry in the Start Menu is a trace for a built-in app that has been removed in the successive upgrade. Depending on where you are seeing the error, follow the steps in the article below to resolve this error on your computer.

## 1\. How to Fix the "ms-resource:Appname/Text" Error in the Start Menu

 You can remove the "ms-resource:Appname/Text" entry from the Start Menu by removing the affected application package using PowerShell. Additionally, you can kill the StartMenuExperienceHost.exe process in Task Manager to restart the service.

 Before attempting to remove the app, package, and restart the services, check if you have any Windows updates pending. If you are running a fresh install, try to install all the pending Windows updates. These updates often include bug fixes and may be the only thing you need to do to fix this issue.

 To check and install Windows updates:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the **Settings** app.
2. Open the **Windows Update** tab.
3. Click on **Check of updates**. Continue to download and install all pending updates.
4. Restart your computer to apply the updates and check if the issue is resolved.

 If the issue persists, you can use PowerShell to remove the affected app package and then restart the associated services to fix the problem.

 To remove the "ms-resource:Appname/Text" entry from the Start Menu:

1. Press the **Win** key and type **powershell**.
2. Right-click on **Windows** **PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.  
![remove holographicsfirstrun app powershell windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/remove-holographicsfirstrun-app-powershell-windows.jpg)
3. In the PowerShell window, type the following command and press **Enter**:  
`Get-AppxPackage -all *HolographicFirstRun* | Remove-AppPackage -AllUsers`

 Once you've run the command, be sure to restart your computer.

1. After the computer restarts, [open Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-task-manager-on-windows-11/).
2. Next, open the **Details** tab in Task Manager. On Windows 11, click the three horizontal lines icon to access the details tab.
3. Now you need to locate both **StartMenuExperienceHost.exe** and **Explorer** **.exe**. On Windows 11, you can use the search feature in **Task Manager** to locate the processes.  
![end start menu experience host task manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/end-start-menu-experience-host-task-manager.jpg)
4. Right-click on each process and **End Task**.

![run new task open tempstate folder file explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/run-new-task-open-tempstate-folder-file-explorer.jpg)
6. In the **Create new task** dialog, type the following path and click the **Browse** button.  
`%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy`
7. In the File Explorer window, delete the **TempState** folder.
8. Go back to Task Manager, and click **Run new task**.
9. Type **explorer.exe** and select the **Create this task with administrative privileges** option.

 Once done, give your PC another restart.

## 2\. Re-Register Your Microsoft Store Apps

 You can [re-register Microsoft Store apps using PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/reregister-microsoft-store-apps-windows/) to stop the error appearing when using Microsoft apps. Doing so should remove any leftover entries showing up in the Start Menu after the update.

 Wait for the process to complete. This may take a few minutes as the command will try to re-register all the apps, including existing ones. Once the process is complete, restart your computer and check for any improvements.

## 3\. Check the Microsoft Store for App Updates

 You may see the "ms-resource:Appname/Text" entry if Windows attempted an unsuccessful app installation. To fix the issue, check if an update exists for the app in the Microsoft Store.

 To determine the app name click on the app entry and check if you can find any information about the app. If not, right-click on the app entry in the **Start Menu** and select **Open File Location**.

 Alternatively, you can view the application directory to view the installed apps. Press **Win + R** to open Run, type **shell:appsfolder**, and click **OK**. It will open the **Applications** folder. Go through the apps to see if you can locate an app named **ms-resource:Appname/Text** or similar to the entry in the Start Menu.

 Once you have the app name, open the Microsoft Store. Search for the app and check if an update exists. Click **Update** to download and install the update. Once installed, restart your computer and check for any improvements.

### Reset the Microsoft Store App

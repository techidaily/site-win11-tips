## Mastering Permanent Delete: Configuring Windows Trash Bin

 The Windows desktop includes a Recycle Bin repository for "deleted" files. However, dragging and dropping files onto that bin icon doesn’t truly erase them. Files dragged onto the Recycle Bin are stored until the bin gets emptied, and even after then, they’re still recoverable.

 Would you prefer to have a bin on your Windows 10 or 11 desktop that truly deletes files dragged to it beyond recovery? If so, you can add exactly that to the desktop with Free File Wiper and Multi Trash. This is how you can add a desktop trash bin for permanent file erasure to Windows with those apps.

## Standard Deletion vs. Permanent Erasure: What's Wrong With the Default Recycle Bin?

 The Recycle Bin is based on the standard file deletion method. It enables users to delete files either by emptying the bin or bypassing it by pressing the**Shift + Delete** hotkey. Users can also select a**Don’t move files to the Recycle Bin** option for standard file deletion.

![The Recycle Bin Properties window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/recycle-bin-properties-option.jpg)

 Yet, the Recycle Bin’s standard deletion method merely removes a hard drive reference pointer for a file. Doing so marks the drive space a deleted file occupies as available, but the data remains intact until it gets overwritten. This means that non-overwritten files removed with standard deletion can still be recovered with data recovery software. Our data recovery software guide tells you about some of the[best tools you can use for restoring files](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-data-recovery-software/) .

 However, file shredder apps combat data recovery software by thoroughly eradicating files. Those tools permanently erase files by overwriting their data on hard drives. They do that with various data erasure overwrite standards, such as Gutmann’s and Schneier’s algorithms.

 So, you’ll need[third-party file shredder software](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-file-shredder-programs/) if you want to permanently erase files beyond potential recovery. Free File Wiper and Multi Trash are apps that add file shredder bins to the Windows 11/10 desktop. Those are bins you can drag and drop files to for permanent erasure.

 Note that file shredders don’t work on SSD (solid-state drives). Such drives store data on flash memory, which is different from disk storage. However, you can still wipe solid-state drives with the software and methods covered in our guide on[if SSDs can really securely delete data](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ssd-secure-delete-data/) .

6. Double-click**Free\_File\_Wiper.exe** in its extracted directory to run the app.

8. Click the**X** close button on the "Free File Wiper – Help" window.
9. Now you’ll see a Free File Wiper bin icon somewhere on the Windows desktop. Left-click and drag that icon to reposition it if necessary.

 To permanently delete something with the shredder app, bring up Explorer, left-click a file, and then drag it onto the Free File Wiper bin desktop icon. A warning prompt will appear that says you won’t be able to recover the file after wiping it. Select**Yes** if you’re sure about permanently erasing the file.

![The Free File Wiper bin icon on the desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/free-file-wiper-bin-icon.jpg)

 You can change the wipe method for that bin via its context menu. Right-click the**Free File Wiper** system tray icon and select the**Wipe method** submenu. Then choose one of the five options available there.**Maniacal erase** is the most thorough shredding option with several passes.

 Free File Wiper's context menu also includes other options. There you can select alternative transparency levels for the bin icon. Click**Autostart with Windows** to add Free File Wiper to the startup items.

It enables you to right-click a file and select**Show more options** \>**Send to** \>**Free File Wiper** .

 This gadget has a few customization settings. Click its**Options** button to view them on the Multi Trash window. You can change the bin’s color by clicking the**Shredder Glass Color** option on the**Appearance** tab and selecting an alternative one on the palette.

![The Multi Trash window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/multi-trash-settings.jpg)

 Of course, the biggest beauty of Multi Trash is that it’s a 3-in-1 file deletion tool. You can also set it to be a recycle or standard deletion bin for different files. However, only the Shred bin securely erases files beyond recovery. So, use the Shred bin to erase files that include more confidential info.

## Delete Your Files More Securely on the Windows 10 and 11 Desktop

 Adding Free File Wiper or Multi Trash bins to Windows will enable you to delete files and folders more securely from the desktop area. Although there are many other file shredder utilities available, few of them have comparable drag-and-drop functionality. So, Multi Trash and Free File Wiper are more unique tools for shredding files in that respect.

 However, remember it’s not always bad for files to be recoverable, in case you accidentally delete a file you want to keep. Or you might realize you should never have deleted a file later. So, it’s recommended to only permanently erase files you want to ensure other users can’t recover with data recovery software.

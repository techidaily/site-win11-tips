## Deciphering and Dissolving MS Teams Error 80080300 on Win11 Platform

 Many users utilize Microsoft Teams, a free messaging app with Windows 11\. However, some users can’t use that app because of the Microsoft Teams error 80080300\. The 80080300 error displays a message that says, “we’re sorry, we’ve run into an issue.”

 Consequently, users can’t log in to MS Teams when the app throws up that error. Those users might still be able to log in via browsers, but the Windows app displays an 80080300 error code. Here is how you can fix Microsoft Teams error 80080300 in Windows 11.

## 1\. Disconnect Your Microsoft Work or School Account

## 2\. Run Teams in Compatibility Mode

 Teams users have had some joy fixing the 80080300 error by selecting to run that app in compatibility mode. That’s a surprising potential fix considering Teams comes bundled with Windows 11, but users have confirmed it works. So, try running Microsoft Teams in compatibility mode as follows:

1. Open the Explorer drive navigator by pressing the**Windows** key +**E** .
2. Bring up this directory:

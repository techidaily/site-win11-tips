## Fixing Windows 11'S Non-Functional Function Keys for Brightness

 You may usually get eye strain or headaches when the brightness of your laptop or PC monitor is too low. Issues like this can be easily solved by adjusting the brightness with a simple press of the brightness function key.

 However, things get tricky if this key does not work anymore or has stopped functioning. In such cases, you may need to take a few steps in order to fix the brightness function key not working on Windows PC.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 Keyboard issues can sometimes be fixed with a simple restart. Restarting your computer will reset the keyboard settings and may make the brightness key work again.

 If you need, then open this guide and learn [different methods of restarting your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) .

## 2\. Clean Your Keyboard to Remove Dirt and Grime

 Over time, dirt and debris can build up on and between the keys of your keyboard. This especially happens if you use your laptop in a dusty environment. Cleaning the keys can make them more responsive and help fix any problem with the brightness function key not working.

 If you don't know exactly how to clean the keyboard, you can see our guide on [how to clean your keyboard and sterilize viruses and bacteria](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-keyboard/) . You can also read [a simple trick for cleaning under your keyboard's keys](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-simple-trick-for-cleaning-under-your-keyboards-keys/) .

## 3\. Make Sure the Function Key Is Enabled

 The function key may not work if it is disabled on your keyboard. To make sure it is enabled, press the**Fn + Esc** keys simultaneously. Doing this will toggle the function lock on and off. If it was disabled, enabling it should help fix the brightness key not working issue.

## 4\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 The Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter is the next step to try if the above solutions weren't enough. This tool can detect and fix any hardware and device issues on your computer, including the problem with the keyboard. To run the troubleshooter, do the following:

1. Open the Command Prompt window with admin access. If you need help, see our guide on [how to run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .  
![Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter.jpg)
2. Once you're in the Command Prompt window, type and execute the command below:  
`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`

 This will open the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter window. Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the process to detect and fix any problems related to your keyboard and function keys. Once done, you can try using the brightness function key to adjust the screen's brightness.

## 5\. Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter

 If the issue persists, you can run the Windows Keyboard Troubleshooter. This troubleshooter scans and detects any problems with your keyboard that might be causing the brightness function key not to work. Here's how to run this tool:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings window. To learn more, read our guide on how to open the System Settings.
2. In the Settings menu, click**System > Troubleshoot** .
3. Click**Other troubleshooters** on the next page.

4. Scroll down to locate the Keyboard and then click**Run** .

 Once you complete the above steps, try using the brightness function key again to see if the issue is resolved.

## 6\. Update the Keyboard Driver

 An outdated or corrupt driver could also be malfunctioning the brightness function key. In such a case, you can try to update your keyboard drivers and see if it solves the issue.

To update the keyboard driver, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + X** on your keyboard to open the Power User Menu.
2. Choose**Device Manager** from the list of options.
3. Expand**Keyboards** , then right-click on your current keyboard driver and select**Update driver** .  
![Update the Keyboard driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/update-the-keyboard-driver.jpg)
4. Next, click**Search automatically for drivers** .  
![Search automatically for drivers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/search-automatically-for-drivers.jpg)

 Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Once you've done this, restart your computer and check if the issue is resolved.

 If the Fn key is still unresponsive even with a driver update, there may be problems with your keyboard's driver. In that case, uninstall the problematic driver and install it again. Here's how to do it:

1. Open Device Manager and expand the**Keyboards** section.
2. Right-click on your keyboard driver and select**Uninstall device** .  
![Uninstall device in Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/uninstall-device-in-device-manager.jpg)
3. Click**Uninstall** again to confirm and follow the on-screen instructions.

 After performing the above steps, restart your computer to reinstall the drivers. Once you power up again, check if the function key works now.

## 7\. Turn Off the Filter Keys

 Filter keys on Windows are designed to ignore repeated keystrokes and slow down the rate at which a key repeats when held down. It is intended to help users who have difficulty pressing keys on a keyboard.

 However, sometimes it can interfere with normal typing and cause the keyboard not to work properly. To turn off this feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel. You can see our guide on how to open the Control Panel on Windows PC.
2. Click on the drop-down menu next to**View by** and select**Large icons** .
3. Then click**Ease of Access Center** and select**Make the keyboard easier to use** .

![Turn on Filter Keys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turn-on-filter-keys.jpg)
5. Click**Apply** and then**OK** .

Now check if your keyboard is working properly.

## 8\. Scan for Malicious Programs

 If you downloaded any suspicious file or program, then the chances are that your keyboard is experiencing interference due to malware, spyware, or other malicious programs.

 To make sure it isn't the case, you can [check if a file is infected with a virus or not](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-suspicious-file-malware/) . In case you find one, you need to [scan your computer for viruses and then remove them](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/) .

 If you are more comfortable with command line tools, then [use Windows PowerShell to scan and remove any malicious components](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/) from your system.

 This should help you fix the issue of your keyboard not functioning properly.

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.

## Make Use of the Function Key Again on Windows

 It's important to keep your device's brightness settings adjusted to a comfortable level. However, if your brightness function key is not working, here are some quick solutions to make your computer's function keys work again. All in all, these are simple yet powerful tricks for restoring malfunctioning function keys.

## Unverified AI Keys May Jeopardize Win 11 Security

Over the past few days, reports have popped up everywhere about ChatGPT and Bard generating activation keys for Windows 11\. Apparently, people are using AI chatbots to create working access keys for the Windows OS, allowing them to use the software for free.Here’s why this probably won’t work and, even if it does, why you shouldn’t use chatbots to generate Windows 11 keys.

## People Are Using AI Chatbots to Generate Windows 11 Keys

 The first reports of people using ChatGPT and Bard to generate activation keys for Windows emerged from Twitter. Initially, users were posting about older versions of the operating system and, over the past few days, generating keys for Windows 10 and 11\.

 The reports were quickly picked up by news websites and other publications, but few–if any–seem to have checked whether this method actually works. Instead, they’re simply referring to tweets that claim the generated activation keys generated do, in fact, unlock Windows 11\.

 Now, if you go back to many of these tweets posted over the past few days, Twitter itself has added notes, explaining that these codes do not activate the OS.

 Clearly, this isn't what's being reported so widely across the web – so what's really going on here?

## Do AI-Generated Windows 11 Keys Actually Work?

 Unfortunately, using software keys generated by tools like ChatGPT is illegal–so we’re not going to put this to the test. Thankfully, through the forgotten art of research, we can quickly figure out why these activation keys aren't going to work.

 Yes, people are using ChatGPT and Bard to generate activation keys for Windows 11, but this isn't the same thing as successfully using them to activate the software.

 Unsurprisingly, it turns out ChatGPT and Bard are providing default keys for Windows operating systems. With a default key, you can download, install and even upgrade to specific versions of Windows–but there’s a catch. Default keys cannot activate Windows 11 or any other version of the OS.

## Even AI-Generated Activation Keys Work, They're a Bad Idea

 In theory, there is a chance you could generate a working activation key for Windows 11, if you ask ChatGPT or Bard to generate enough of them. Kind of in the same way you might win the lottery if you ask them to predict next week’s numbers enough times.

 However, there’s another problem. Generative AI tools don’t create anything from scratch; they basically copy information that already exists or combine multiple pieces of info into one response.

 So, there’s a good chance ChatGPT is simply copying default keys that are already publicly listed across the internet, or generating look-alikes. If this is the case, you’re not going to get a working activation key, no matter how many times you ask it to generate one.

 Using free or [cheap Windows activation keys is risky business](https://www.makeuseof.com/risks-using-cheap-windows-activation-keys/) and raises several ethical questions. Above all, even if you manage to generate a working activation key with ChatGPT, it’s illegal to use it.

## Don’t Believe Everything You Read Online

 In the age of generative AI, you have to take everything you read with a pinch of salt. These tools have their uses, but the hype and misinformation surrounding AI technology is concerning.

 It’s disappointing to see so many publications cover this story without any research, fact-checking, or due diligence. The moral of the story? Don’t believe everything you read online–or use dodgy activation keys to steal software. And there are plenty other AI chatbot myths circling around online.

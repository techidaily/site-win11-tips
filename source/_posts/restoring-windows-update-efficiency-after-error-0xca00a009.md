 If the process detects any problems, it will try to fix them automatically. Once you have completed the steps above, restart your computer, then update Windows again to see if it fixes the problem.

## 3\. Run SFC and DISM Scan

 If you're still seeing the error, it might be because of a corrupt system file. Try running the System File Checker tool to fix the problem. Here is a quick guide on how to do it:

1. Run Command Prompt as an administrator. To do this, search for "Command Prompt" and select**Run as administrator** .
2. Type the below command line and press Enter:

* Copy and paste the following command and press Enter:  
`Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth  
Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth`

 You may need to wait for a while for the process to be completed. Restart your computer after running the DISM command and check if the error has been fixed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

`gpupdate  
gpupdate /force`

 When you are done with the above commands, close the Command Prompt window and update Windows again to see if the problem has been resolved.

## 5\. Clear the SoftwareDistribution Folder

 Software Distribution stores temporary files that may be required to run Windows Updates. And when these files become corrupted, these types of errors may occur. In this case, you can clear the contents of the folder and see if it works.

To clear the SoftwareDistribution folder, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt with Administrative Privileges.
2. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt and hit Enter after each one:  
`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits  
net stop cryptSvc  
net stop msiserver`
3. After executing the above commands,[open Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and browse to "C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\."
4. Inside the SoftwareDistribution folder, press**Ctrl + A** to select all the contents and tap Delete on your keyboard.
5. If you are asked to grant permission via a pop-up menu, click on**Continue** to proceed.
6. When you have deleted the contents of the SoftwareDistribution folder, you will need to restart any services that were stopped earlier. To accomplish this, open the elevated command prompt again and run the following command:  
`net start wuauserv  
net start bits  
net start cryptSvc  
net start msiserver`
7. Now type exit and press Enter to close the Command Prompt window.

 When you have completed all of the above steps, restart your computer and try updating Windows again after you've completed all the steps.

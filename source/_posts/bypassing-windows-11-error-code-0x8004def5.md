## 2\. Check if OneDrive Servers Are Down

 OneDrive stores all your data in a dedicated cloud server maintained by Microsoft. Despite promising 99% uptime, it is common for cloud services like OneDrive to encounter outages. Or the service could be down due to scheduled maintenance.

 You can visit the[Microsoft Service Health page](https://portal.office.com/servicestatus) to check which services are down. Alternatively, you can use third-party websites like[DownDetector](https://downdetector.com/) . That way, you can know if other users also face the same server outage issue. If that's the case, you have to wait until Microsoft resolves the problem and brings up the OneDrive servers again.

## 3\. Completely Shut Down and Reboot Your Computer

 Background services are susceptible to glitches and crashes. If one or more such essential services encounter a glitch, it can impede apps that rely on them. However, Windows 11 enables Fast Startup by default which preserves the state of all system and kernel processes for speeding up boot time.

 Even if you shut down the system, it will not close and restart all processes and services. So, you must perform a complete shutdown. Repeat the following steps to do so:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** keys to open the command prompt with administrator privileges.
2. Now, type the following command and press the enter key:**shutdown /s /f /t 0**  
![Perform a complete system shutdown](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perform-a-complete-system-shutdown.jpg)
3. A complete shutdown will take longer than usual. Wait for the system to Restart and boot to the desktop.
4. Now, launch OneDrive and check if you can access your files.

## 4\. Switch Network Connections

 It is possible that your current ISP, or the network you are connected to, blocks Microsoft's servers. Many users shared they were able to fix the issue when they switched to another network. You can simply create a wireless hotspot from your phone or use USB tethering to share the internet with your Windows computer.

 After that, relaunch the OneDrive app and check if you can access your files on the network. You can also request your ISP to remove the block on your connection to access the OneDrive servers seamlessly in the future.

## Do Windows Themes Affect Performance?

 The design of your computer can have a huge impact on how you approach work and play. A clean, organized desktop environment can help you stay focused and productive. So does this affect performance? In a way, yes.

Instead, they're just a way to customize the look and feel of your computer without putting in any extra effort. In fact, some users find that changing up their theme helps to keep them more engaged with their work.

 However, certain themes may require more memory or processor power in order to run correctly than others. Therefore, if you are looking for maximum efficiency from your device, it would be wise to select a lighter-weight option such as the Education Themes offered by Windows.

1. Click the**Start icon** on the taskbar or press the**Win key** to open the Start menu.
2. Click the**Power icon** in the bottom right corner.
3. Select**Sleep** from the menu that appears.

## 3\. Using the Sleep Key on Your Keyboard

 Many Windows laptops and computers come with a dedicated sleep key that allows you to enter sleep mode quickly. The exact location of this key can vary depending on the make and model of your computer.

 The sleep key is usually labeled with a**crescent moon** or a**Zz** icon. You can press that key while holding the**Function** or**Fn** key to put Windows into sleep mode.

## 4\. Converting the Power Button Into a Sleep Button

2. Select**Terminal (Admin)** from the list.

## 8\. Set Up Automatic Sleep Mode on Windows

 You can also configure your Windows computer to enter sleep mode automatically after a certain period of inactivity. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Navigate to**System > Power & Battery** .
3. Click the downward arrow next to**Screen and sleep** .

## 9\. Create a Desktop Shortcut to Put Windows to Sleep

 If you would rather not go through lengthy procedures, you can create and use a desktop shortcut to put your computer into sleep mode.

 For this to work, you’ll need to [disable hibernation mode on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-hibernate-enable-disable/) . Once you’ve done that, use the following steps to create a desktop shortcut to put your computer to sleep.

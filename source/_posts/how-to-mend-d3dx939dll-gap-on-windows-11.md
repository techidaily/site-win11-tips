## How to Mend D3DX9_39.dll Gap on Windows 11

 Is your Windows computer displaying an error message stating "d3dx9\_43.dll is missing from your computer"? If so, you may be dealing with a missing or corrupted version of DirectX software—a crucial component for running several multimedia tasks on Windows such as gaming and video playback.

 Luckily, there are a few ways you can try to fix the D3DX9\_39.dll missing error on Windows. But before that, let's see what causes this error code.

## What Causes D3DX9\_39.dll to Go Missing?

 The D3DX9\_39.dll file is a DirectX library dynamic link library (DLL) that enables DirectX applications to run properly on Windows computers. Without this file, many of these applications simply won't work, especially games that use DirectX's libraries to run.

 There are a few causes of the D3DX9\_39.dll missing error. It includes incorrect installation of DirectX, a system infection by malicious software, or the file being corrupted for any reason. In most cases, however, it is simply the file being corrupted or missing from its location. If you're looking to get back into gaming or use your Windows applications, resolving this error is essential.

 So, how can you fix this error? Here are some solutions you can try on your Windows device:

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 One of the simplest and most often recommended solutions to fix a DirectX-related issue is restarting your computer. It refreshes all processes and resets system memory, which can often solve the issue.

To restart your computer, follow these steps:

1. Save and close any open programs on your computer
2. Now press**Win + R** on your keyboard.
3. In the Run dialog box, type**shutdown /r** and hit Enter.
4. Your computer will restart automatically

 After restarting, try running the application again to see if the error is still present. If you're lucky, your computer will be able to recognize and load the necessary DLL files upon reboot—without any further intervention.

## 2\. Reinstall DirectX

 If restarting your computer doesn't work, you can try installing DirectX to the latest version. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to the[Microsoft DirectX download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Download/confirmation.aspx?id=35) . This will automatically download the latest version of DirectX for your Windows system.
2. After downloading, press**Win + R** on your keyboard.
3. Type**Downloads** in the text box and hit Enter.
4. Next, double-click on the executable file to install it.
5. When UAC prompts appears on the screen, click**Yes** to continue.

 Once you've reinstalled DirectX on your computer, restart your computer. After that, try running the program that was causing the D3DX9\_39.dll missing error and see if this resolves the issue.

 Once the installation is complete, try to launch the application again and check if the error still appears. If yes, proceed to the next step.

## 4\. Reinstall the Problematic Program

 If the d3dx9\_39.dll error still persists, it's likely that the application you want to run might be corrupted or improperly installed. To fix this issue, try reinstalling the program and see if it works then. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Control Panel and select**Uninstall a program** .
2. Select the problematic application from the list of installed programs.
3. Click**Uninstall** and select**Yes** in the confirmation box.
4. Restart your computer and reinstall the program from its official site.

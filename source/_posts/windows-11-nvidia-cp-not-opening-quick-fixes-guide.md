## 1\. Run the NVIDIA Control Panel With Admin Rights

 Most users usually select to open the NVIDIA Control Panel from Windows 11’s desktop context menu. However, you can select to run that app as an administrator in the following steps:

1. Right-click your taskbar’s Start menu button and select the**Search** shortcut.
2. Type**NVIDIA Control Panel** in the search box.
3. Right-click the**NVIDIA Control Panel** result to select a**Run as administrator** on that app’s context menu.

 Setting NVIDIA Control Panel to always run as administrator is tricky because that UWP app is installed within a restricted access folder. You’ll need to[take ownership of the WindowsApps folder](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-own-folder/) to open that directory. Then select the "Run as administrator" option for the nvcplui.exe file. The default path for the file is:

`C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\NVIDIACorp.NVIDIAControlPanel_8.1.963.0_x64__56jybvy8sckqj\nvcplui.exe`

## 2\. End NVIDIA Background Processes

 Sometimes you can’t see NVIDIA Control Panel when multiple instances of it are already running. Ending NVIDIA background processes will enable you to restart the app. This is how you terminate background NVIDIA background processes:

1. Bring up the**Task Manager** tool (pressing**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc**) is the quickest method for opening it).
2. Select**Processes** if a different tab opens with Task Manager.
3. Next, scroll down the**Processes** tab to find NVIDIA processes.
4. Select all NVIDIA processes and click their**End task** buttons.

6. Try opening the NVIDIA Control Panel again.

## 3\. Start (or Restart) the NVIDIA Display Container Service

 A common reason for the NVIDIA Control Panel not opening is a disabled NVIDIA Display Container service. Other NVIDIA services also need to be enabled for the app to work right. So, you should check that service and others are enabled and running like this:

1. Bring up Windows 11’s file search utility.
2. Type**Services** into the file search box and select to run that app from there.
3. Scroll to and double-click**NVIDIA Display Container LS** .  
![The Service window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-service-window.jpg)
4. Next, select the**Automatic** option if the**Startup** menu setting is set to anything else.  
![The Automatic option the Startup type menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/startup-type-drop-down-menu.jpg)

6. Make sure you click**Apply** for saving the settings.
7. Select**OK** to exit the NVIDIA Display Container LS Properties window.
8. Repeat steps three to seven for the NVIDIA LocalSystem and NetworkService Container services.

## 6\. Install Missing Visual C++ Redistribute Packages

 Another possibility is that the NVIDIA Control Panel doesn’t open because your PC is missing a required Visual C++ Redistributable package to run it. You can eliminate this possible cause by updating Visual C++ packages on your PC if needed. This is how to install a missing Visual C++ Redistributable in Windows:

1. Open up the[Microsoft Visual C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) download page in your browser software.
2. Click the X64 link for the latest Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 packs.  
![The X64 download link](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/x64-link.jpg)
3. Double-click the**VC\_redist.arm64.exe** (Visual C++ installer) file once it's downloaded.

## 7\. Edit the Windows Registry

 This Windows Registry tweak creates a new context menu option for opening the NVIDIA Control Panel. As this solution involves deleting a key, we recommend you learn[how to back up the Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before proceeding.

To apply this fix, edit the Registry as follows:

1. Open Registry Editor by pressing the**Win + R** keyboard shortcut, typing**regedit** in the Run dialog, and clicking**OK** .
2. Input this key location in the registry address bar and press**Return** :  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Directory\background\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers`
3. Click the**NvCplDesktopContext** subkey with the right mouse button and select**Delete** .
4. Select**Yes** to confirm that you’re sure about deleting the**NvCplDesktopContext** key.
5. Erase the path currently in the registry bar, and input this different location:  
`Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell`

1. Next, right-click**Shell** and select**New** .
2. Click**Key** to add a new subkey to**Shell** .
3. Type**Nvidia Control Panel** to be the new key’s name.
4. Then right-click the**Nvidia Control Panel** subkey and select its**New** and**Key** context menu options.
5. Input**command** for the subkey’s title.
6. Select**command** and double-click its**(Default)** string.
7. Next, input the following path in the**Value data** box:  
`C:\Windows\System32\nvcplui.exe`
8. Select**OK** to save the string value.
9. Now select to reboot your Windows 11/10 PC.

## 8\. Reinstall the NVIDIA Control Panel

 The NVIDIA Control Panel is a UWP app you can uninstall, download, and reinstall. If none of the other fixes in this guide work for you, that app might have corrupted or missing files. To do so, remove the NVIDIA Control Panel in Settings, as outlined in our guide for[how to uninstall apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .

![The Uninstall app option in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-uninstall-option-in-apps-features.jpg)

Then click**Get in Store** app on the[NVIDIA Control Panel](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/nvidia-control-panel/9NF8H0H7WMLT) [Microsoft Store page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/nvidia-control-panel/9NF8H0H7WMLT) .

## Guiding Users Through Terminal Restart on Win11

 Windows Terminal is the next-generation command line platform in Windows 11\. It provides an improved user experience with modern command line tools that enable you to access multiple command lines in a single window. The tool is essential for developers and administrators alike, but sometimes your terminal settings need to be reset to default.

 In this article, we will explain how to reset your Windows Terminal settings back to their original state.

## Why Would You Reset Your Windows Terminal?

 Windows Terminal is an amazing tool for power users and developers. It allows you to access a variety of tools, all in one place, with custom settings and themes that make it easy to work from anywhere. But over time, your Windows Terminal may become cluttered with old settings or themes that have become redundant or are no longer relevant.

 It also helps clear out any potentially harmful malware or corrupt files that might be lurking in the background of your system, hindering your productivity. By doing so, you will ensure that your computer works as fast and as smoothly as possible - giving you the most optimal experience when using this powerful tool.

 Let's now move to the below sections and see how it can be reset.

## How to Reset Windows Terminal Settings by Clearing JSON Files

 In order to reset the settings back to the original defaults, you will need to delete the settings.json file. Here's how to do it.

1. Right click on Start and select**Terminal** from the menu list.
2. Next, click the down-arrow icon and select**Settings** .
3. From the left pane of the Settings page, click**Open JSON file** .

 Next time you open the app, a new configuration with all the default settings will be created automatically.

## How to Reset Windows Terminal Settings Using Command Prompt

 The Command Prompt is a command line tool that can help you accomplish a number of tasks on your computer.

 To reset Windows Terminal Settings back to their defaults, follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Prompt. For this, use the Taskbar search or type "cmd" in the Run dialog.
2. In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command:

## How to Reset Windows Terminal Settings From File Explorer

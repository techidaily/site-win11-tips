## Keeping Your Windows Notes Prominent

 Windows 10 and 11 version comes with the Sticky Notes app. It is a handy little app to quickly jot down bits of information and scribble other notes for easier access.

 While the app supports basic editing tools and even lets you add images to your notes, it lacks the always-on-top feature. With always on top, you can keep the Sticky Notes app on top of others all the time.

 In this guide, we show you how to keep Sticky Notes always on top using Microsoft PowerToys and DeskPins.

## 1\. Use Microsoft PowerToys to Keep Sticky Notes Always on Top

[Microsoft PowerToys](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-powertoys/) features a collection of advanced Windows customization utilities. You can use it to disable sleep mode on your PC, resize images, perform bulk renaming using search-replace, and keep apps always on top.

 The Always on Top feature in PowerToys lets you pin app windows on top of other apps. Once enabled, you can use the default Windows + Ctrl + T shortcut to pin Windows apps on top.

 Here’s how you can use the Always On Top feature in Microsoft PowerToys to pin the Sticky Notes app on Windows.

1. Open the [Microsoft PowerToys page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) and install the app from Microsoft Store.
2. You can launch the app from the recently installed list or system tray.
3. In the PowerToys Settings window, open the**Always on Top** tab**.**

4. Next, toggle the**Enable Always on Top** switch and set it to**On** .
5. Next, under**Activation** , note down the**Activation shortcut** . By default, it is set to**Win + Ctrl + T** . To change the shortcut combo, click the**Edit** button (Pencil icon) and make changes.

6. Under**Appearances & behavior** , toggle the**Shows a border around the Pinned window** to disable the highlighted border for the pinned app.
7. Next, open the Sticky Notes app. To do this, press the**Win** key**,** type**sticky notes** and open the app.
8. To pin Sticky Notes, click on the app window and press**Win + Ctrl + T.** You will hear a sound when the window is pinned.

 Once pinned, Sticky Notes will always stay on top of other apps. To unpin the window, Press**Win + Ctrl + T** , and the app will act like any other open window on Windows. Make sure to allow PowerToys to run in the background for the Always On Top feature to work. Also, you’ll need to pin the apps each time you close and relaunch them.

## 2\. Use DeskPins to Pin Sticky Notes

 DeskPins is a third-party open-source utility to pin app windows on Windows OS. It officially supports Windows 10 and earlier editions; however, we also tested it and found it working on Windows 11.

 The app offers Pins that you can activate with hotkey and pin any window on top of other Windows. Click the Pin icon again to unpin the window.

To pin Sticky Notes using DeskPins:

1. Go to the [DeskPins page](https://efotinis.neocities.org/deskpins/) and download the latest version available.
2. Run the installer and keep all the options selected.
3. Once installed, search for**DeskPins** and click on the**App** icon to launch the app.

4. Next, open the**system tray** (up arrow icon in the bottom left corner of your desktop) and click on the**DeskPins** icon to activate a Pin.

5. Next, click on the**Sticky Note** app window to keep it always on top.
6. Click the**Pin** icon to unpin the window.

 You can further customize the app with Hotkeys, set auto pin rules, and customize pin color and tracking rate. To do this, right-click on the**DeskPins** icon and select**Options** to access the customization features.

## Keep Sticky Notes Always on Top in Windows 10 and 11

 The Sticky Notes app is an excellent productivity tool if you need to continuously jot down ideas and notes. With PowerToys’s Always On Top feature, the app can stay pinned forever on your desktop and not get lost with the other hundred apps in the background. Alternatively, use DeskPins if you find PowerToys overkill for this task.

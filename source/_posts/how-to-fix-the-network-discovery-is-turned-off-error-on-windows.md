## What Causes the "Network discovery is turned off" Error on Windows?

 This error typically occurs when the [Windows Network Discovery feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-network-discovery-turn-on-off/) is disabled. You may have disabled this feature accidentally or reset the network settings that disabled it. Other possible causes include:

* Services required for Network Discovery to work are turned off.
* Network adapter drivers are outdated.
* Network Discovery isn't whitelisted in Windows Defender—so the firewall turned it off.

 Now, let's explore some solutions to resolve this issue.

## 3\. Enable the Services Network Discovery Depends On

 Five essential services must be enabled for Network Discovery to operate correctly:

* Function Discovery Provider Host
* Function Discovery Resource Publication
* SSDP Discovery
* UPnP Device Host
* DNS Client

 You should ensure these services are active and set to start automatically with these steps:

1. Open the **Services** app by typing"services" in Windows Search.
2. Locate the specific service (as mentioned above) you want to check and enable.
3. Right-click on the service and select **Properties**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Repeat this process for each of the other four services. Afterward, run the same process that triggered the error earlier. If the error persists, apply the next fix.

## 4\. Whitelist Network Discovery From Windows Defender

 You may experience the "Network discovery is turned off**"** error if the Windows Defender Firewall blocks your connection to the network. To remove this, whitelist the feature in Windows Defender:

1. Type "Windows Security"in Windows Search and open the Windows Security app.
2. Navigate to the **Firewall and network protection** tab on the left and click **Allow an app through firewall** on the right.  
![Opening the firewall settings from the Windows Security app.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/opening-the-firewall-settings-from-the-windows-security-app.jpg)
3. Press the **N** key a few times to find Network Discovery.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. If the **Public** and **Private** boxes are checked next to **Network Discovery**, the feature is already whitelisted through the firewall.
5. If none of these boxes are checked, click on **Change settings**, check the boxes, and click **OK**.  
![Whitelisting the Network Discovery in the firewall settings in Windows Control Panel.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/7-whitelisting-the-network-discovery-in-the-firewall-settings-in-windows-control-panel.jpg)

## 5\. Reset the Windows Defender Firewall Settings

 If whitelisting the feature doesn't fix the problem, [reset Windows Defender Firewall's settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-windows-firewall-settings/). This will revert the firewall to its default configuration, removing any custom rules or settings you may have configured.

 If you use any third-party antivirus software as your primary security suite and it's currently active, temporarily disable it.

 Resetting Windows Firewall is a more drastic action that can affect other network functions. Always proceed cautiously, as this could impact other applications and network settings. Be sure to note any custom settings or rules before the reset so you can recreate them afterward.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Update the Network Adapter Drivers

 Outdated network adapter drivers could be a potential cause of this error. To rule out this possibility, update those drivers to the latest version available. There are [different ways to install network adapter drivers on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-intel-network-drivers-windows/). The most reliable approach is downloading them from the manufacturer's website and manually installing them using Device Manager.

 The above solutions will allow your Windows computer to discover other networked devices. Note that if you're on a domain network, group policies can override local settings, and you may be unable to change Network Discovery settings without administrative permissions.

### Key Takeaways

* Ensure Network Discovery is enabled in the Settings app.
* Check that the essential services required for Network Discovery to work are turned on.
* Whitelist Network Discovery in Windows Defender Firewall.

 When you encounter the "Network discovery is turned off" error while searching for other devices on a network, networked computers and devices will not be visible to your Windows PC. This guide explains the solutions you can apply to fix it.

## 5\. Reset the Windows Defender Firewall Settings

 If whitelisting the feature doesn't fix the problem, [reset Windows Defender Firewall's settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-windows-firewall-settings/). This will revert the firewall to its default configuration, removing any custom rules or settings you may have configured.

 If you use any third-party antivirus software as your primary security suite and it's currently active, temporarily disable it.

 Resetting Windows Firewall is a more drastic action that can affect other network functions. Always proceed cautiously, as this could impact other applications and network settings. Be sure to note any custom settings or rules before the reset so you can recreate them afterward.

## 6\. Update the Network Adapter Drivers

 Outdated network adapter drivers could be a potential cause of this error. To rule out this possibility, update those drivers to the latest version available. There are [different ways to install network adapter drivers on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-intel-network-drivers-windows/). The most reliable approach is downloading them from the manufacturer's website and manually installing them using Device Manager.

 The above solutions will allow your Windows computer to discover other networked devices. Note that if you're on a domain network, group policies can override local settings, and you may be unable to change Network Discovery settings without administrative permissions.

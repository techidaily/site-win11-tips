## 7 Ways to Locate Elusive 'Gpedit.msc' On PC

 Using the Group Policy Editor is a convenient way to implement system-wide changes on your Windows PC. However, you may not be able to use it if you keep getting interrupted by the “Windows cannot find gpedit.msc” error.

 Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to fix the error. Below are some fixes that should help restore your access to the Group Policy Editor on Windows in no time.

## 1\. Check Your Windows Version

 It's important to note that the Group Policy Editor (or gpedit.msc) is only available on Professional, Education, and Enterprise editions of Windows. If you are running Windows Home, you may encounter the “Windows cannot find gpedit.msc” error while opening the Group Policy Editor.

 If you are unsure, follow these steps to determine which version of Windows you are running:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **winver** in the text box and press **Enter**.
3. In the About Windows dialog that appears, check the Windows version.

 If you see **Windows 10 Home** or **Windows 11 Home**, you will need to upgrade to the Professional edition of Windows to access the Group Policy Editor on your PC.

## 2\. Enable Group Policy Editor if Your PC Is Running Windows Home

 Although Microsoft has reserved Group Policy Settings for the Professional and higher editions of Windows, it is possible to enable the Group Policy Editor in Windows Home with a simple workaround.

 So, if you're looking to avoid the expense of upgrading to a different Windows version, refer to our guide on [how to access the group policy editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

## 3\. Use Alternative Methods to Open the Group Policy Editor

 If you get the error message "Windows cannot find gpedit.msc" despite using a compatible version of Windows, you can try alternative methods to open the Group Policy Editor.

 Instead of using the Start menu or the Run command, try to open the Group Policy Editor via the Command Prompt. For that, open the Command Prompt using the search menu. Type **gpedit.msc** into the console and hit **Enter**.

## 4\. Try Generic Fixes

 If the above solutions do not fix the error or if you experience a similar error with other apps, you can try some generic Windows fixes listed below.

* **Restart Your PC:** Although it might come across as a common piece of advice, [restarting your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) can often resolve temporary issues and get things working properly again. If it’s nothing major, this should restore your access to the Group Policy Editor.
* **Install Windows Updates:** Such problems can also arise due to an outdated or flawed Windows build. Try [installing pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) to see if that fixes the “Windows cannot find gpedit.msc” error.
* **Scan for Malware:** Another possible cause for such errors is a malware infection. To rule out this possibility, you can consider [scanning your Windows PC for malware using PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/) or an antivirus program.
* **Perform a Factory Reset:** If nothing else works, you can try [factory resetting your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) as a last resort. This should restore Windows to its default settings, effectively resolving any issues.

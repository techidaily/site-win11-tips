 ManicTime is a powerful assistant that gives you a clear idea of your computer usage habits. You can track and measure apps, files, and internet URLs within a set time frame.

 The Timeline view provides a color-coded graph of how long different apps have been used. You can easily zoom in and out or highlight a specific region of the day by dragging your cursor. Above the timeline, you can also see a record of active and inactive computer usage which can help you [limit screen time](https://www.makeuseof.com/limit-screen-time-without-screen/).

 ManicTime features some of the most accurate tools to help you understand your computer usage. The left sidebar displays a list of time entries (recorded automatically.) Beside each entry, you’ll see a start and end time and a duration. You can use the **Filter** option to highlight a specific app and view its total duration. You’ll also find duration values on the right sidebar alongside a percentage of its usage.

 ManicTime does a brilliant job of tracking your computer usage, and you can access all the essential features in the free version.

## 6\. Timely

![Timely timeline view](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/timely-timeline-view.jpg)

 Timely is an [AI-powered productivity app](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-productivity-apps-powered-by-ai/) that offers an efficient solution to record your PC usage. Its detailed history section lists activities from both browser tabs and Windows apps.

 During the setup phase, you’ll install Memory: Timely’s automatic time-tracking extension to record your PC usage. After a day of PC usage, simply head back to Timely to view your statistics. You can view your usage in two formats: a list or a timeline view. You can also add time entries manually. For super-detailed analysis, you can view time spent on individual tabs, which is far more useful than seeing one entry labeled “Internet.”

 If you’re using Timely solely for work, you can train Timely’s AI to recognize what types of activities to ignore. It can also generate timesheets and provide time management suggestions. Timely also offers a bunch of other time management tools, such as a timer and a scheduling tool.

**Download**: [Memory](https://timelyapp.com/downloads) for Timely (Subscription required, free trial available)

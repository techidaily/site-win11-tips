## Mastering File Syncing on Windows: The Most Rated Apps

 While you can always use a USB drive to move your files around, there are now many Windows apps out there that will help you do the same with just a few clicks. So, how do you pick the best one? Is price the best indicator of quality? Is it the underlying classification, whether open-source or closed-source?

 Like anything else, what’s best for you depends on what you want. This stands true in the case of file-sharing apps as well. We’ve rounded up various file-sharing tools that you can use for sharing your files on a Windows PC with ease.

## 1\. SHAREit

 SHAREit is a peer-to-peer file-sharing app that will help you transfer your files. While the app is famous and known to many Android users, it can also help you to share your files from one PC to another. A slew of features made us pick this tool for this guide:

1. It helps you transfer your files like photos, music, and videos that you can later share.
2. Cellular data free.
3. Enables you to transfer files between your phone and computer.
4. Transfer your files over hotspots.
5. A multi-platform app.

 On top of being one of [the fastest ways to transfer files between PC and mobile devices](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/x-fastest-ways-transfer-file-pc-mobile-device/) , the ShareIt app also has a cleaning feature. For example, with only a few taps, you can wipe your phone clean of all the junk and give it a quick speed boost.

 Feem is the best offline file transfer tool in this list. It can transfer large files from one device to another without any interruptions or breaks—it relies on the internet for this and doesn’t put any limit on file size. The app is available for major platforms, and while the Feem app is definitely a handy tool, you can also use the web app version, which will help you transfer your files simply from your browser.

 You can give the free version of the app a go first, which does come with some understandable limits, and see if it helps you. If you like the free version, you can pick from various paid options.

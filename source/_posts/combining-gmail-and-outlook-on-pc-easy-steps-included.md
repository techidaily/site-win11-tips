## Combining Gmail & Outlook on PC: Easy Steps Included

 Microsoft Outlook is the main email client for Windows. Among other brilliant features, the newer Outlook for Windows preview directly integrates Microsoft 365 apps into a side panel, so you can quickly access all your important files and notes.

 More importantly, it supports an improved Gmail integration that allows users to directly access their email, contacts, and calendar through the Outlook for Windows preview app.

## How to Get the Outlook for Windows Preview App

 Before we get Gmail accounts into Outlook, we need to get the preview version of the app. The Outlook for Window preview app is available to users who have signed up for the Microsoft 365 Insider (formerly Office Insider) program. The latest version of Outlook aims to help users work more efficiently through a rich design and many new features.

 If you have a valid personal or family Microsoft 365 subscription, you can register for the Insider program for no additional cost. Once you’ve signed up, choose between the**Beta Channel** or**Current Channel (Preview)** .

 The Outlook for Windows Preview app gives you access to the modern Outlook email client with newer features and a fresh user interface. To start with the Outlook for Windows Preview app, check out the[official Microsoft 365 Insider site](https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/join/windows) .

 Once you’ve set up Microsoft 365 on your Windows PC, you can enable Outlook for Windows preview by sliding the**Try the new Outlook** toggle button in the top-right corner of your Microsoft Outlook client.

 Alternatively, you can try Outlook for Windows Preview through the**Mail** and**Calendar** apps on Windows 10 and 11\. Simply launch the apps via the**Start** menu and enable the**Try the new Outlook** toggle button.

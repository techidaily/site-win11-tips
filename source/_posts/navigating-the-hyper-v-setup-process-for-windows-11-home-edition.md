## Navigating the Hyper-V Setup Process for Windows 11 Home Edition

 You can enable Hyper-V in Windows 11 as an optional feature included by default with the operating system. It lets you create virtual machines to install and run the guest OS on virtual hardware. However, Hyper-V is only available for the Pro, Education, and Enterprise edition of the OS. If you are using the Home edition, you have to rely on a third-party virtual machine manager.

 If you don’t want to use a third-party virtual machine manager, here is how to install Hyper-V on Windows 11 Home using a batch script hack.

## How to Enable Hardware Virtualization in Windows 11
![enable hardware virtualization bios hp laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enable-hardware-virtualization-bios-hp-laptoop-1.jpg)

 Hyper-V is a bare-metal hypervisor and requires [Hardware Virtualization enabled in BIOS to work](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-virtualization-and-what-is-it-for/). Most modern systems support Hardware Virtualization, and you can enable it in BIOS.

 The below steps are for an HP laptop. Refer to the user manual or Knowledge Base resources on the computer manufacturer's website for other systems.

 To enable Hardware Virtualization in BIOS:

1. Shut down your PC if it is powered on.
2. Press the **Power** button to turn on the computer and then start pressing the **F10 key** to enter BIOS. The BIOS setup key varies depending on the manufacturer. So, use **F10, F2, F12, F1,** or **DEL** and see which one works for you.
3. Once in the BIOS Setup utility, open the **Configuration** tab.
4. Use the down arrow key and highlight **Virtualization Technology.**
5. Hit **Enter** and then select **Enabled**. Press **Enter** again to make the selection.
6. Next, press **F10** to save the changes and exit **BIOS**.
7. Your PC will restart with the Hardware Virtualization enabled. Now you can continue to install Hyper-V on your system.

## How to Install Hyper-V on Windows 11 Home

 The next step is to create and run a batch script to install the required files to enable Hyper-V in Windows 11 Home.

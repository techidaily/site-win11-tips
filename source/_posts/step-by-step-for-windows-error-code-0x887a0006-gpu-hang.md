## Step-by-Step for Windows Error Code 0X887A0006: GPU Hang

 Many Windows gaming enthusiasts have reported that they're encountering a DXGI\_ERROR\_DEVICE\_HUNG error. This error regularly crashes some players‚Äô games shortly after starting them or when they‚Äôre playing. It displays an error message window that includes a 0x887A0006 code and says, ‚ÄúA problem has occurred with your display driver.‚Äù

 Microsoft has described the DXGI\_ERROR\_DEVICE\_HUNG error to be a command communication issue between system hardware and games. This error is a big deal when it keeps crashing affected Windows games. However, players have resolved the 0x887A0006 error with these potential fixes.

## 1\. Set Affected Games to Run With Administrator Rights

 Make sure the games that error 0x887A0006 crashes have full system access by running them with administrator rights. You can temporarily select to run a game with admin rights or set it to always run with elevated privileges. This is how you can configure an affected game to run as an administrator:

1. First, bring up Windows 11‚Äôs file manager with a method in our [guide for opening Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. Then open the installation folder that contains the game‚Äôs EXE (application file).
3. Right-click the game‚Äôs EXE file and select **Properties**.
4. Click the properties window‚Äôs **Compatibility** tab.
5. Select **Run this game as administrator** to give the game elevated privileges.

6. To save the settings, press the **Apply** button.
7. Then try playing your affected game to see if this potential solution makes a difference.

## 2\. Select Debug Mode in the NVIDIA Control Panel

 Some players have fixed the 0x887A0006 error by selecting **Debug Mode** in the NVIDIA Control Panel. That option disables GPU (graphical processing unit) overclocking. If your PC has an NVIDIA graphics card, you can select the **Debug Mode** option as follows:

## 5\. Roll Back the Most Recent Graphics Driver Update

 A few players have said they fixed error 0x887A0006 by rolling back graphics drivers. Applying such a resolution will restore the previous graphics driver installed on your PC. If the file for your previous graphics driver remains saved, you can select to roll back the driver via Device Manager.

## 6\. Update Your GPU‚Äôs Driver

 The 0x887A0006 error message explicitly says that an issue has occurred with your PC‚Äôs display (graphics) adapter. That could mean there‚Äôs an outdated graphics driver on your PC that isn‚Äôt compatible with affected games. The probable solution in such a scenario is to update the driver for your PC‚Äôs GPU.

 You can update an NVIDIA or AMD driver in a few different ways. Some users utilize driver updater software packages, but some of them don't update graphics drivers to the newest ones available. To ensure you‚Äôre installing the very latest driver available for your GPU, download it from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.

 Our guide for [updating your graphics drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) provides further details about the various methods.

## 7\. Disable DirectX 12 in Any Affected Games

 DirectX 12 is the more advanced alternative version to DX11 that‚Äôs known to generate issues for some games. So, it‚Äôs recommended that you disable DX12 by setting DX11 for games where the 0x887A0006 error occurs.

1. First, open Epic Games Launcher.
2. Click the circle button that includes your user initials.
3. Select the **Settings** option on the menu that opens.

4. Then click the game title for which 0x887A0006 arises.
5. Select the **Additional Command Line Arguments** box.

## 8\. Switch to the High-Performance Power Plan

2. Type **powercfg.cpl** in the text box and click the matching search result.

If so, it‚Äôs recommended you disable (undo) any overclocking you‚Äôve applied by restoring default system values with whatever overclock software you utilize.

 You can disable NVIDIA GPU overclocking with the method outlined for resolution two. However, that option won‚Äôt be available on PCs with AMD graphics cards. Nor will it be of any use for users who‚Äôve overclocked CPUs.

## 10\. Edit the GraphicsDrivers Registry Key

 Disabling Timeout Detection and Recovery is another potential 0x887A0006 error fix some players have confirmed works.

## Stop the 0x887A0006 Error Spoiling Your Gaming Fun

 It‚Äôs likely that one of those Windows 11/10 solutions will fix the 0x887A0006 error for affected games on your PC. There are also other potential resolutions for this issue since it has variable causes. Disabling game overlays, turning off Steam Cloud syncing, and updating Windows and DirectX are additional potential fixes for error 0x887A0006 that might also be worth a try.

## Rebooting to Standard Power Plans: Guide for Win 11

 Windows 11 and 10 come with preset power plans: High Performance, Power Saver, Balanced, and sometimes Ultimate Performance. You can switch between these plans to get the best performance, more battery life or a bit of both worlds. Some laptop manufacturers, like HP, have their own power plan, like HP Recommended.

 However, often after installing a Windows update, default power plans can go missing, or you may see only one power plan. This can also happen if you have made changes to your power plans recently. In any case, here are a few troubleshooting steps to help restore the missing default power plans on Windows 11 and 10 running systems.

## How to Check Which Power Plan Is Missing

 Depending on your system hardware specification, you may see three or four power plans in the Power Options panel. Balanced, Power Saver and High Performance are the most common in all Windows computers.

 However, higher-end hardware running Windows 11\\10 Pro can have the Ultimate Performance Power plan as well. It is a preset power plan to help boost your system performance in a professional setup. Even if available, enabling the [Ultimate Performance power plan may not be necessary for most users](https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-enable-ultimate-performance-power-plan-windows-10/) .

 You can check the available and missing power plans on Windows from Control Panel:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**control** and click**OK**
3. In the**Control Panel** , open**Hardware and Sound.**

[On Windows 11, you can change the power mode from the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-power-plan/) . You can choose between the Best power efficiency, Balanced, and Best performance power modes in the Power & battery settings.

2. In the**System** tab, scroll down and click on**Power & battery** .

3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

powercfg -duplicatescheme 381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e  
[Power Saver]  
powercfg -duplicatescheme a1841308-3541-4fab-bc81-f71556f20b4a  
[Ultimate Performance]

4. If successfully executed, type**exit** and press**Enter** to close Command Prompt.

 You can use a different**powercfg** command to enable the High Performance power plan on Windows. This is useful if your system is missing only the High Performance power scheme. Here’s how to do it.

2. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`powercfg /s SCHEME_MIN`
3. After the command is executed, close the Command Prompt window.
4. Next, go to **Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options** . Here, you can use the**High Performance** power plan.

 If the power plans are still missing, check if Modern Standby (S0) is enabled. If yes, you’ll need to disable Modern Standby to restore the missing power plans.

## 5\. Disable Modern Standby (S0) to Restore Default Power Plans

 If you have a Modern Standby (S0) compatible system, check if this sleep state is enabled. When enabled, the default power plans may be disabled to prevent any conflict when the system is in a low-power idle state.

 As you may have guessed already, in this situation, you’ll need to [disable Modern Standby (S0) on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-disable-modern-standby/) to restore the default power plans on Windows. After you disable Modern Standby (S0), open Power Options to use the default power plans.

 Conversely, you may encounter BSOD and other critical errors after disabling Modern Standby (S0). If yes, enable Modern Standby again to fix the issues.

## 6\. Manually Create the Power Plans

 If you don’t want to use the preset power plans, you can create your own power plans on Windows. This should work irrespective of the Modern Standby state of your computer.

To create a custom Power Plan on Windows:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**control** and click**OK** to open**Control Panel.**
3. Go to**Hardware and Sound.**
4. Next, click on**Power Options** .

## Restore the Missing Default Power Plans on Windows

 Power plans on your Windows laptops help you manage how your device uses power. If you don’t see the power schemes on Windows, try to reset the default power plans using PowerShell. Similarly, you can also use PowerShell to duplicate and restore the existing power plans.

 That said, not seeing the Ultimate Performance power plan in Power Options is not unusual. By default, it is only available on high-end Windows hardware and disabled to prevent battery draining. But you can still enable it using a PowerShell cmdlet. For most users, however, the balanced power plan offers a great balance between performance and battery life.

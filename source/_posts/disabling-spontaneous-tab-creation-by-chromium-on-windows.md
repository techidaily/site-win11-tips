## Disabling Spontaneous Tab Creation by Chromium on Windows

 Does Chrome open new tabs whenever you click a link on a search engine results page or a website? If that's the case, Chrome is probably set to open every new link in a new tab.

 If new tabs are opening automatically, most likely the website you're on is malicious, your keyboard manager or browser extensions are interfering with the browser's operation, or your browser or device is infected with malware.

 If you'd like to open new links in the same tab or stop the browser from opening new tabs automatically, here are a few fixes you can try.

## 1\. Apply Some Preliminary Fixes

 To troubleshoot the issue, perform the following fixes first, as they may resolve it right away:

* Open Task Manager, go to the **Processes** tab, find and right-click on the **Chrome** process, then click **End task**. After that, start the browser over again.
* [Clear the cache and cookies in Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) to prevent outdated cached data from interfering with browser processing.
* Check if any of the extensions on your browser are disrupting the browser process by disabling them one by one.
* [Update Chrome to the latest version](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-google-chrome/).
* Incorrectly configured keyboard and mouse managers can also cause apps like Chrome to malfunction. Disable or delete such an app if you also use one.

## 2\. Ensure That the "Open New Tabs" Shortcut Keys Aren't Pressed Down

 If Chrome opens new tabs immediately upon launch and doesn't stop until you close the browser, the shortcut keys for opening new tabs are probably pressed down on your keyboard. You can confirm that using the onscreen keyboard in Windows.

 Simply press **CTRL + Win + O** to open the on-screen keyboard and check whether the shortcut keys to open a new tab in Chrome (**CTRL + T)** are pressed. If you see them pressed, check that the keys aren't stuck. If the keys are in their normal position but appear pressed on the on-screen keyboard, there is likely a hardware issue with the keys.

![Check if the Shortcut Keys to Open New Tabs in Chrome Aren’t Pressed on the On-Screen Keyboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-check-if-the-shortcut-keys-to-open-new-tabs-in-chrome-aren-t-pressed-on-the-on-screen-keyboard.jpg)

 If this is the case, unplug or [temporarily turn off your keyboard](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-disable-laptop-keyboard/) and have it inspected. However, if no keys appear to be pressed, move on to the next step.

## 3\. Stop Chrome From Opening Links in New Tabs

 Chrome comes with a built-in feature that lets users open links in new tabs. This feature helps users open and go through multiple links from the search engine results page at once without having to go back and forth.

 If you want Chrome to open links in the same tab, taking over the current search engine results page, you must turn off this setting. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Search for any query in Chrome and press the **Enter** key.
2. In the top-right corner, click **Quick Settings (gear icon)** and click **See all Search settings**.  
![Open See All Search Settings in the Chrome Quick Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-open-see-all-search-settings-in-the-chrome-quick-settings.jpg)
3. Navigate to the **Where results open** section and uncheck the box beside **Open each selected result in a new browser window**.

## 4\. Stop Chrome From Opening New Tabs on PC Startup or Browser Launch

 If Chrome automatically launches and opens new tabs when your Windows device boots up, you probably granted it permission to do so. To turn off this permission, open Task Manager, navigate to the **Startup apps** tab, locate **Chrome** in the list of applications, right-click on it, and choose **Disable**.

![Disable Chrome From Startup Apps in the Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/disable-chrome-from-startup-apps-in-the-task-manager-1.jpg)

 If new tabs open up at browser startup, you've probably configured the browser to open a set of new tabs at its launch or to open the tabs you left open when you last used the browser. Follow these steps to remove these permissions:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Click the **three vertical dots** in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **On startup** tab and check the circle besides **Open the New Tab page**.

## 5\. Ensure That the Website You Are on Isn’t Malicious

 If Chrome opens new tabs with unwanted websites whenever you click on a text, link, or area on a particular website, that site or its content is likely malicious. That might explain why it redirects you to malicious offers and landing pages run by threat actors.

 There are many ways to determine whether a website is untrustworthy, so learn [how to check if a site is safe](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-safe-to-use/) for more information.

## 6\. Ensure Your Browser and Device are Malware-Free

 The Chrome browser can also misbehave or act strangely if infected with malware or viruses. If none of the fixes above resolve the problem, your browser could be infected with a [browser hijacker](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-browser-hijacking/).

 If the problem persists despite removing the hijacker, you may have a malware infection on your device, forcing Chrome to open unwanted websites on its own. To rule out this possibility, [run a full malware scan using a Microsoft Security scanner](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-safety-scanner-guide/) to get rid of any possible infections.

## 7\. Reset and Reinstall Chrome

 If you find that your browser doesn't have any infections and the virus scan does not detect any malware on your device, you should reset it. By resetting a browser, its settings are restored to their defaults, so you can confirm that misconfigured settings aren't the cause of your problem.

 To reset Chrome, go to **Chrome** settings, click on **Reset settings** on the left-hand side, and click **Restore settings to their original defaults** on the right.

![Click Restore Settings to their Original Defaults Option to Reset Chrome Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-click-restore-settings-to-their-original-defaults-option-to-reset-chrome-settings.jpg)

 If resetting the browser also doesn't work, you can reinstall the browser from scratch, which is the least desirable solution. Before you begin the new installation, ensure you properly remove the old installation using our guide on [uninstalling apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/).

## Stop Chrome From Opening New Tabs on Windows

 New tabs automatically opening or Chrome opening new tabs for every click can disrupt our user experience. Hopefully, you now better understand why Chrome opens new tabs and what fixes you should try to stop it.

 If nothing works and Chrome keeps opening new tabs, reinstall the browser. If reinstallation also fails, scan your device for malware infection or switch to a different browser.

 Does Chrome open new tabs whenever you click a link on a search engine results page or a website? If that's the case, Chrome is probably set to open every new link in a new tab.

 If new tabs are opening automatically, most likely the website you're on is malicious, your keyboard manager or browser extensions are interfering with the browser's operation, or your browser or device is infected with malware.

 If you'd like to open new links in the same tab or stop the browser from opening new tabs automatically, here are a few fixes you can try.

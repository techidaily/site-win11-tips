## Override Unmet System Conditions Indicator in Win11

### Key Takeaways

* Windows 11 has stricter hardware requirements, resulting in a "System requirements not met" watermark for unsupported hardware.
* You can remove the watermark by modifying the Registry Editor or using the Group Policy Editor.
* New updates may cause the watermark to reappear, requiring you to repeat the removal steps.

 If you are running Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, the newer operating system version will show a "System requirement not met" watermark in the bottom left corner of your screen.

 This may not be a concern if you use the OS in a virtual machine. But a watermark can stick out like a sore thumb for most people. Fortunately, you can remove the system requirements not met watermark with a registry hack and the Group Policy Editor.

## Why Does Windows 11 Show the "System Requirements Not Met" Watermark?

 Microsoft Windows 11 has a much [stricter hardware requirement](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-your-pc-run-windows-11/) than its predecessors. If your system does not meet the minimum system requirement, including TPM 2.0, the installation will stop abruptly.

 However, with the problem came many workarounds that allowed you to [bypass the restriction and install Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/bypass-windows-11-minimum-installation-requirements/) on unsupported hardware.

 While Microsoft initially allowed installation on unsupported hardware with a warning about security issues and lack of future updates, it has now [decided to put a permanent watermark](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-windows-11-unsupported-watermark/) to remind the users that their system is not supported. A similar message may also appear in the Settings app.

## 1\. Remove the "System Requirement Not Met" Watermark Using the Registry Editor

 If you see the "system requirements not met" watermark on your PC, you can remove it by modifying a DWORD value in Registry Editor.

 As modifying the Windows Registry involves risk, [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before making any changes using the Registry Editor.

 Follow these steps to remove the "System requirement not met" watermark in Windows 11:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **regedit** and click **OK** to open the Registry Editor.

## Brightening Dull Cursors in UEFI

 Newer computers come with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) as the new standard. However, Legacy BIOS is still largely part of most active systems due to legacy software and hardware support. Switching from UEFI to Legacy BIOS is easy using the firmware utility. But what if the legacy boot option is grayed out in BIOS?

 This can happen for a few reasons. A common reason for the grayed-out BIOS is if you have Secure Boot or Platform Trusted Technology (TPM) enabled. Issues with Modern Standby supported system is another reason that prevents you from switching from UEFI to Legacy BIOS.

 Here is how to fix the Legacy Boot grayed-out in BIOS issue on your Windows system.

## What Causes the Legacy Boot Grayed Out Problem?

 You may find the Legacy Boot option grayed out if the UEFI settings, such as Secure Boot and TPM are enabled in the BIOS utility. In some instances, the BIOS utility can tell you why you can't switch to the Legacy boot option.

 Boot into your BIOS utility and open**Advanced Boot** **Options** . Next, check the**Enable Legacy Option ROMs** option. You may see an error prompt explaining why the Legacy option cannot be enabled. It usually hints that PPT/TPM or Secure Boot is enabled.

 If you don't have any such option, try the troubleshooting steps below to restore the Legacy boot option in BIOS.

## 1\. Disable Secure Boot to Enable Boot

 Secure Boot is a UEFI feature that protects your computer against malware by allowing only trusted system software to run on your computer. When enabled, it will perform a cryptographic check during the boot process to verify the integrity of the system image.

 However, if you have Secure Boot enabled, it will likely disable Legacy Boot as well. You'll need to [disable Secure Boot in your BIOS utility](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/disable-secure-uefi-dual-boot/) to fix the issue.

## Winning at Files: Directories for Game Access

 It's time to open the installation directory of a game, but how do you actually do that? Lots of guides will tell you to open this directory, but not many actually tell you what that entails.

 Let's have a look at different ways you can track down a game directory.

## 1\. Follow the Shortcut ![screenshot of the right click menu showing open file location](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screcreenshot_of_right_click_menu_open_file_location.jpg)

 The easiest way to find the directory for most games, as well as general programs, is to follow the shortcut.

 If you have a shortcut for the game on your desktop, you're able to right-click on this shortcut and click the option **Open file location.** This will open a file window to the location that shortcut points to. For many games, their shortcut should open up the installation directory.

 Some game directories store their .exe in different locations. You might arrive at the root directory, or you may arrive at a folder imbedded in this directory. Either way, you're in the right place.

## 2\. Via the Properties Menu ![screenshot of the binding of isaac properties menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot_of_binding_of_isaac_properties_menu.jpg)

 Another option would be to use that same shortcut to view the **Properties** menu.

 This will display different information about the shortcut you're viewing. Under the **Shortcut** tab, you'll see a field listed as **Target.** This is the file path to the installation directory. All you have to do is [copy this path and paste it into Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-copy-full-file-folder-path-windows/).

 This will bring you to the installation directory, as well as tell you exactly where that is.

## 3\. Via the Game Launcher ![screenshot of the binding of isaac in steam showing browse local files](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot_of_binding_of_isaac_steam_browse_local_files.jpg)

 If you've installed your game with a game launcher, such as Steam, or through the Epic Games Store, you'll find easier ways to open up game directories.

 For example, in Steam, you just need to find the gear icon on a games page or right-click on the game's title. Under **Manage**, click on **Browse local files.**

 Most modern game launchers will have this feature, so take a look around within your launcher of choice for said option.

 If you still can't track down the game launcher you're looking for, remember that games are just like any other program. All common [ways to find installation directories in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-find-programs-install-location/) will work for games, too.

## Finding the Game Directory Is Easy

 Games are just programs, so there are plenty of ways to find their installation directory. Whether you're modding the game or just need to see some files, you'll be able to do so by the shortcut or the game launcher itself.

 Let's have a look at different ways you can track down a game directory.

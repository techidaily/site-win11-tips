 In practical terms, you can make phone calls, read and send text messages, get notifications, and more—straight from your PC. So let’s look at all the different ways to connect your Android to a Windows PC.

## How to Sync Your Android With Windows

 Interestingly, there's a vast diversity of ways to record your files on Windows. In fact, there are more than a few ways to do this: Phone Link app, Unison app, and even third-party apps like AirDroid are a few examples.

 Let’s look over them all one by one.

### 1\. Phone Link

 Phone Link, formerly Your Phone, is a free Windows app from Microsoft that lets you connect your Windows 10 or Windows 11 to Androids or iOS devices. Although [there are ways Microsoft can improve Phone Link](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-microsoft-improve-phone-link-windows-11/), the [Phone Link app still offers a myriad of features that make it a pleasure to use](<http://Phone> Link app still offers a myriad of features), such as:

* Feature to make and receive calls from your PC.
* Receive and manage your mobile notifications.
* File transfer between PC and your smartphone.
* Read and reply to messages straight from your PC.

 Given the above and similar features, installing and using it to connect your Windows to Android makes sense. To get started, we ask you to [go through our Phone Link guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-your-phone-app-guide/) to learn how to connect your Android with a Windows PC.

### 2\. Intel Unison

 Just like the Phone Link, Intel Unison is specifically designed to help you connect your Android or iOS devices to a Windows PC. Install the app, and you can then move your files and images between devices, receive notifications, and respond to text messages with ease.

 Both Phone Link and Intel Unison are pretty much similar in their functionalities; the only noticeable difference is perhaps their integrations—while Phone Link has more features and integration for Microsoft products, Intel Unison is geared more towards Intel users.

### 3\. AirDroid Cast

 AirDroid Cast is a popular app on the web. Many people use it for all kinds of things—from remotely controlling your Android from a PC to real-time screen sharing, AirDroid Cast supports it all.

**Step 1: Download AirDroid Cast**

 To get started with AirDroid Cast, first download the AirDroid Cast app on your Android from PlayStore, and the Windows app from the official AirDroid website.

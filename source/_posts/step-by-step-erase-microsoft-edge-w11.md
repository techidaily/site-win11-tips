 Although Microsoft Edge has made significant progress in recent years, it still lags far behind its biggest rival—Google Chrome. If you’re someone who does not like using Microsoft Edge, you may want to get rid of the browser entirely.

 Although uninstalling Edge from your computer is easy, it does not prevent newer Windows updates from potentially reinstalling the browser.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**regedit** in the box and press**Enter** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. In the Registry Editor window that appears, navigate to**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Microsoft** key.
5. Right-click on the**Microsoft** key, go to**New** , and select**Key** from the submenu. Rename the key to**EdgeUpdate** .
6. Right-click on the**EdgeUpdate** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Rename the DWORD to**DoNotUpdateToEdgeWithChromium** .
7. Double-click on the newly created DWORD and change its value data to**1** . Then, hit**OK** .

 Once you complete the above steps, Windows will not reinstall Microsoft Edge with future updates.

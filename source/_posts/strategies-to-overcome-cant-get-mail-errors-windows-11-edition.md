 Are you getting the "System error can't get mail" error when accessing your emails through the Mail app? This error usually occurs when the Mail app doesn't have permission to access your email or when your system is showing an incorrect date and time.

 Fortunately, fixing the "System error can't get mail" error is a breeze. Simply apply the solutions below to troubleshoot the problem for good.

## 1\. Start With Some Quick and Simple Fixes

### Log In and Out of Mail, Then Restart the App

 To log out of the Mail app, right-click on your account in the left sidebar and choose**Account settings.** Then, select the**Delete account** **from this device** option and click**Delete** in the following window.

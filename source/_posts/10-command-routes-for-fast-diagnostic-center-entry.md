 You’ve probably heard of the Windows System Information tool before. It’s an incredible app that provides detailed information about your PC. But how do you access this app in the first place?

 To answer that, we’ll cover all the ways ways to access the System Information app on Windows.

## 1\. Use the Start Menu Search Bar

 The Start menu search bar makes it easy for you to open almost any app on your device. You can use this tool to access the system settings, built-in apps, and all your third-party apps.

 Let’s explore how you can use the Start menu search bar to open the System Information app:

1. Press**Win + S** or click the**Start menu search bar icon** on the taskbar.
2. Type**System Information** and then select the**Best match** result.

## 2\. Use File Explorer's Address Bar

 You can also use File Explorer's address bar to open various apps. In most cases, this tool comes in handy if the Start menu search bar isn't working.

 Now, here’s how to open the System Information tool using File Explorer’s address bar:

1. Press**Win + E** to open File Explorer.
2. Type**msinfo32** in File Explorer’s address bar and press**Enter** to open the System Information app.

## 3\. Use the Run Command Dialog Box

 Alternatively, you can access the System Information tool using the Run command dialog box.

 Interestingly, the Run command dialog box can help you access almost any program on Windows.

 Now, here’s how to open the System Information tool using the Run command dialog box:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type**msinfo32** and press**Enter** to open the System Information tool.

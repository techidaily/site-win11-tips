## Unraveling Media Maker Tool Error X.90017 On Windows

 The Media Creation Tool lets you upgrade your PC to a new Windows version or create a bootable Windows USB drive. At times, when you try to run the tool, you may encounter the error code 0x8007043C - 0x90017.

 The primary reason for this error is insufficient permission to run the tool or if it has been blocked from running on your PC. You can unblock it from the tool's properties to fix the error. Here is how to fix the Media Creation Tool 0x8007043C - 0x90017 error and perform an upgrade or create a bootable drive.

## 1\. Run the Media Creation Tool as an Administrator

 You can fix permission issues by executing the Media Creation Tool with administrator privileges. By default, the tool does not require administrator rights to run. But you can [manually run Windows apps as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ways-to-run-a-program-as-administrator-in-windows/) to see if that resolves the error.

To run Media Creation Tool as administrator:

3. Click**Yes** when prompted by UAC. Wait for the tool to launch and check for any improvements.

## 2\. Unblock the Media Creation Tool

 Windows can block suspicious executable files from running to protect your computer. However, it can also block genuine files due to false positives.

 If you have downloaded the Media Creation Tool from the Microsoft website, check if the file is blocked on your PC. If yes, you can unblock the executable file from the Properties dialog. Here’s how to do it.

1. Navigate to the location where the Media Creation Tool is saved.
2. Select and right-click on the tool and select**Properties** .
3. In the**General** tab, locate the**Security** section.
4. Next, check the**Unblock** option.

5. Click**Apply** , and the security option will disappear.
6. Next, click**OK** to apply the changes.
7. Run the Media Creation Tool again, and it should work without the 0x8007043C - 0x90017 error.

## 3\. Install Any Pending Windows Updates

 If the error occurs during an upgrade, ensure you have installed all the latest updates available for your PC. Often Windows updates consist of performance improvements and bug fixes. Install all the updates to see if that helps you resolve any issues interrupting the upgrade process.

To update your Windows computer:

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .

6. If not, click**No** in the Windows Update troubleshooter dialog.
7. Next, click on**View detailed** information. Here you can view the issues found and potential issues that were checked.

## 5\. Check for a Third-Party Antivirus Conflict

 Third-party antivirus can be overzealous and block genuine system modifications as malicious. You can disable the security app temporarily to determine if your third-party antivirus is triggering the error.

 Once disabled, relaunch the Media Creation Tool and check if the error persists. If not, check and reconfigure your antivirus settings or switch to one of the [best antivirus solutions on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/) .

## 6\. Run the DISM and System File Checker Tool

1. Press the**Win** key and type**cmd** .
2. Right-click on**Command** **Prompt** and select**Run as administrator.**
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command to run the DISM tool:  
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
4. ![DISM scan health restore health command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dism-scan-health-restore-health-command-prompt.jpg)  
 Press**Enter** to execute the command. It may take some time for the process to complete. Once the process reaches 100%, you can run the System File Checker tool.
5. Type the following command and press**Enter** to run the System File Checker utility:  
sfc /scannow
6. The verification can take several minutes. So wait for the verification to reach 100%. The return will indicate if any issue is found and if the tool was able to fix it.
7. Type**exit** and press**Enter** to close the Command Prompt.

## 7\. Use Rufus to Create a Bootable USB Drive

 While Media Creation Tools lets you create a bootable drive, it is not your only option. You can use a popular third-party app, Rufus, to [create a bootable Windows USB drive](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-bootable-usb-drive/) . You can [download a Windows 11 ISO file](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-download-iso/) from the Microsoft servers and then use it to create an installation media using Rufus.

 Rufus is safe to use and offers some customization, such as choosing a partition format. You can also download the ISO file using Rufus.

## 8\. Perform a Repair Reinstall or Clean Install Windows

 If all else fails, a clean install may be necessary. Make sure to create a backup of your data and then learn [how to clean install Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11/) .

## Fixing the Media Creation Tool Error 0x8007043C - 0x90017 Error

 If you face the same problem, don’t fret. Below, we’ve listed some effective solutions that will help fix the problem in no time.

## 1\. Run the Power Troubleshooter

 Running the built-in troubleshooters on Windows is the most effective way to fix common system-level issues. In this case, you can run the Power troubleshooter and see if that gets hibernate mode to work again. Here's how.

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Click on **Troubleshoot**.
3. Select **Other troubleshooters**.
4. Click the **Run** button next to **Power**.

 Allow the troubleshooter to scan your system for any issues and resolve them. Then, try using the hibernate option again and see if it works.

## 2\. Disable Fast Startup

 Fast Startup is a useful feature that helps you [avoid slow boot times on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-slow-boot-issues/).

2. Type **control** in the box and click **OK** to open the Control Panel.
3. Click on **Power Options**.
4. Click on **Choose what the power buttons do** from the left sidebar.

 Restart your PC after this and check if the issue is still there.

## 3\. Reset Your Power Plan

1. Use one of the many [ways to run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. Type the following command in the console and press **Enter**.

## 4\. Try Basic Fixes to Resolve Hibernation Problems on Windows

 If the above fixes prove ineffective, you can try some generic Windows fixes to resolve issues with hibernate mode.

* **Scan for Malware:** The presence of malware can result in a wide range of system issues, including the one discussed here. To overrule this possibility, you can try [using Microsoft Defender’s offline scan to find and remove malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-malware-using-microsoft-defenders-offline-scan/).

* **Install Windows Updates:** Keeping your Windows PC updated to the most recent version allows you to benefit from the latest bug fixes and improvements.

## Office Integration: A Concise Guide to Windows 10/11

 Microsoft Works is a discontinued office suite the big M replaced with MS Office Stater in 2010\. Works was a cheaper alternative to Microsoft Office. That suite incorporated word processor, spreadsheet, and database applications with more limited features than MS Word, Excel, and Access.

 You can still utilize Microsoft Works 9 on a Windows 10 or 11 PC today. Although that suite might be a little dated, it’s freely available and comes with a good range of templates for document creation. This is how you can install and try out Microsoft Works on a Windows 11/10 PC.

## How to Download and Install Microsoft Works 9

 The Microsoft Works suite isn’t generally available on software download sites. However, you can still install and utilize that software with an MS Works ISO file preserved on the Internet Archives website.

 If you’re wondering [what an ISO is](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-iso/), it’s a file created from an optical disk. Thus, the Works ISO is from the disc with which users installed that suite. You can download and install Microsoft Works 9 with that ISO file as follows:

1. Open this [Internet Archives webpage](https://archive.org/details/microsoft-works-9) in your browser.
2. Click the **ISO IMAGE** download link.  
![The ISO Image download option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iso-image.jpg)
3. Double-click the **Microsoft Works 9.ISO** file and click **Open** if a Security Warning dialog box pops up.  
![The Open option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/open-option.jpg)
4. Then double-click the **Setup.exe** file for Microsoft Works 9\.
5. Click **Next** inside the Microsoft Works setup window.
6. Click **Create a desktop shortcut** to select that option.

7. Select the **Install MS Works 9** option.
8. Click **Continue** to install other components.
9. Then select **OK** on the dialog box that confirms MS Works is installed.

 Microsoft Works is now installed on your PC. You should see an icon for MS works on the desktop. Double-click that desktop shortcut to launch MS Works.

 If Works doesn’t start for you, try running it in compatibility mode. Right-click the Works desktop shortcut to select **Properties** \> **Compatibility**. Click the **Run this program in compatibility mode** setting and choose **Windows Vista** on the drop-down menu. Select **Apply** to save the **Vista** compatibility mode setting.

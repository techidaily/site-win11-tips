To test your connection, try accessing other websites in your browser. If you have a fine internet connection, but it's very slow, you just need to [troubleshoot your network](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-slowing-down-home-wifi-network/).

## 2\. Restart Your Computer and Try Again

 Sometimes, a simple restart can fix minor computer issues. It may also help if you experience system instability or frequently encounter this error. Restarting your computer will refresh the system, clearing out any corrupted data that may have caused this issue. So before proceeding, [restart your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) and try updating again.

## 3\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run box.
2. Type **ms-settings:** in the text box and click **OK**.

 After following the above steps, the troubleshooter will scan your system for errors. When it’s done, the troubleshooter will present you with any solutions it finds. Follow the on-screen instructions and apply any recommendations to fix the problem.

## 4\. Clear the SoftwareDistribution Folder

 The Software Distribution folder is where Windows stores data related to updates. It includes temporary files and download logs. Corrupted or missing system files in this folder can cause the 0x8024800C issue. To fix it, you must delete these files from your system. Here’s how:

 To get started, [open Command Prompt with administrative privileges](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). Once you're in an elevated command prompt window, run the following command:

`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits`

 This will halt the Windows Update service and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service.

 Now use the **Win + E** shortcut key to open File Explorer. Then navigate to the "C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution" folder and delete all its contents. You don't need to delete the folder itself; just the files within it.

![Clear SoftwareDistribution Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/clear-softwaredistribution-folder.jpg)

 Once you're done, go back to the Command Prompt and type the following commands:

`net start wuauserv  
net start bits`

 This will restart the Windows Update service and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service. Now try downloading updates for your computer.

## 5\. Disable Third-Party Antivirus Software Temporarily

 If you're experiencing problems updating Windows, your antivirus might be the culprit. These programs can sometimes interfere with Windows Update components, causing errors like 0x8024800C. To be sure, we recommend [disabling your antivirus temporarily](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-windows-security-windows-11/) and checking if this solves the issue.

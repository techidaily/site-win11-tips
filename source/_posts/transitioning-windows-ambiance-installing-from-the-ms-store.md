## Transitioning Windows Ambiance: Installing From The MS Store

 Using the default Windows theme over a period of time can get painfully dull after a while. But if you're a Windows user, you don't have to stay stuck with old and boring theme settings. In fact, Microsoft has made it possible to install and use new themes, all with a few clicks.

 In what follows, we will cover how you can install a theme from the Microsoft Store without any hiccups. So let's jump right in.

## How to Install a Theme on Windows PC

 While the Windows Store was introduced back with Windows 8, themes only became officially available on the Windows Store with the Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 15007\. Moreover, the build has since become an integral part of tweaking the appearance of your Windows. So here's how you can install a theme on Windows:

* Head to the**Start menu** search bar, type in 'settings,' and select the best match.
* Click on**Personalization > Themes** . Look for the**Change Theme** section.

 From here, you can select the theme you would like to use on your PC from now on. But for now, we are looking at how to get new themes for your Windows. So follow the steps below:

1. In the**Change Theme** section, click on**Get more themes** **in Microsoft Store** .
2. Microsoft Store will be launched on your PC, and from there, you can select a new theme.
3. Click on a theme you like, and select**Get** .
4. When the download gets completed, click on**Open** and you will be taken to your**Themes** section again.
5. Click on the new theme, and it will be instantly applied to your PC.

 Note that to be able to download a theme successfully, you need to be using a Windows that's activated. If it's not, all the buttons and options will be simply grayed out.

 If your Windows has already been activated, and you have followed the above steps carefully, the new theme on your PC will automatically install and display itself.

## How to Tweak Your New Windows Theme

 Installing a new theme isn't where the customization ends, though. For example, after installing a new theme, head to the top of the**Themes** section on your**Personalization** settings menu. From there, you can tweak the background, color, sounds, and even the mouse cursor of your PC. So, there's a lot of room for fiddling around with your new themes.

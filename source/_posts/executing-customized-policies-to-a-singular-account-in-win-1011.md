## Executing Customized Policies to a Singular Account in Win 10/11

 When applying a local group policy to your PC, you may not want it to paint over all users. The answer is to apply local group policy to a specific user or set of users. This way you can control which features are accessible to specific user accounts.

 It also makes it easy to apply and modify controls and appearances for individual users, and you’ll get a quick glance at which policies apply to which users. Here’s how to apply local group policy to specific user accounts on Windows 10 and 11\.

## What Is the Local Group Policy?

 Group Policy is a Windows feature that gives you more control over the things user accounts are able to do and have access to. Changing Group Policy changes how the system works for different sets of users. We’ve covered [what Group Policy is and how you can use it](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-group-policy/), with examples, in much more detail separately.

## How to Apply a Local Group Policy to a Specific User Account

 First off, you must have Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions to access the Local Group Policy Editor. Here’s how to set up what’s called a [Microsoft Saved Console](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-management-console-how-to-use-it/) (MSC) for a specific user.

1. Press **Win + R**, type “mmc” into the box, and hit **OK**. This will open the Microsoft Management Console.
2. You will be presented with a UAC prompt. Click on **Yes**.
3. In the Microsoft Management Console window that opens up, go to **File > Add/Remove Snap-in**.

## 6\. Update or Reinstall Your Bluetooth Drivers

 Malfunctioning or corrupt Bluetooth drivers on your PC could also be the source of the problem. If that seems to be the case, updating the Bluetooth driver should help.

1. Right-click on the **Start** icon and select **Device Manager** from the list.
2. Expand the **Bluetooth** section, right-click on the **Bluetooth adapter**, and select **Update driver**.
3. Select **Search automatically for drivers** and allow Windows to install the best available drivers.  
![Update Bluetooth Driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Update-Bluetooth-Driver.jpg)

 If the Bluetooth entry is missing from the Device Manager, visit your Bluetooth adapter manufacturer's website to download the driver and install it manually.

 If updating the driver does not help, you’ll have to reinstall the Bluetooth drivers. To do so, open the Device Manager again, right-click on the **Bluetooth driver**, and then select **Uninstall device**.

 Once removed, restart your PC. Windows should install the missing Bluetooth driver during boot, and the Bluetooth option should appear on your PC.

## 7\. Disable and Re-Enable the Problematic USB Driver

 Several users on a [Microsoft Community post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-11-bluetooth-disappears-fixes-2023/34f5c8b1-b5a1-4323-a7f6-4513c733d731) reported restoring the missing Bluetooth functionality on their computers by disabling and re-enabling the USB drivers. You can also give it a go.

1. Open Device Manager using the search menu.
2. Expand **Universal Serial Bus controllers**.
3. Look for any entries with a yellow warning triangle. Right-click it and select **Disable device**.
4. Select **Yes** to confirm.
5. Right-click on the USB driver again and select **Enable device**.

## 8\. Run SFC and DISM Scans

 Bluetooth issues can also arise if critical system files are missing from your computer. Windows includes a couple of [tools that can help you replace any missing or damaged system files](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) with their cached version. Here’s how to run them.

1. Press **Win + X** and select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
2. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt shows up.
3. In the console, run the following command:

`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for the scan to complete, and then run the DISM (or Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan.

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After the scan is complete, restart your PC and check if the issue is still there.

## 9\. Boot into Safe Mode

 When you boot Windows into Safe Mode, it runs without any non-essential drivers and programs. This can help you verify if the issue is caused by a third-party driver or program running in the background.

 Windows 11 gives [several options for booting into Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/). You can use any of your preferred methods to enter Safe Mode and see if the Bluetooth option appears. If it does, then a third-party program or service is to blame. In that case, you’ll have to remove any recently installed apps or programs to fix the issue.

 Has the Bluetooth option disappeared on your Windows 11 computer? This can happen for several reasons, including temporary glitches, damaged Bluetooth drivers, and issues with the Windows OS. If you're unsure about what caused the problem, here are some tips that will help.

## 6\. Update or Reinstall Your Bluetooth Drivers

 Malfunctioning or corrupt Bluetooth drivers on your PC could also be the source of the problem. If that seems to be the case, updating the Bluetooth driver should help.

1. Right-click on the **Start** icon and select **Device Manager** from the list.

![Update Bluetooth Driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Update-Bluetooth-Driver.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If the Bluetooth entry is missing from the Device Manager, visit your Bluetooth adapter manufacturer's website to download the driver and install it manually.

 If updating the driver does not help, you’ll have to reinstall the Bluetooth drivers. To do so, open the Device Manager again, right-click on the **Bluetooth driver**, and then select **Uninstall device**.

 Once removed, restart your PC. Windows should install the missing Bluetooth driver during boot, and the Bluetooth option should appear on your PC.

## 7\. Disable and Re-Enable the Problematic USB Driver

 Several users on a [Microsoft Community post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-11-bluetooth-disappears-fixes-2023/34f5c8b1-b5a1-4323-a7f6-4513c733d731) reported restoring the missing Bluetooth functionality on their computers by disabling and re-enabling the USB drivers. You can also give it a go.

1. Open Device Manager using the search menu.
2. Expand **Universal Serial Bus controllers**.
3. Look for any entries with a yellow warning triangle. Right-click it and select **Disable device**.
4. Select **Yes** to confirm.

## 8\. Run SFC and DISM Scans

 Bluetooth issues can also arise if critical system files are missing from your computer. Windows includes a couple of [tools that can help you replace any missing or damaged system files](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) with their cached version. Here’s how to run them.

1. Press **Win + X** and select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
2. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt shows up.
3. In the console, run the following command:

`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for the scan to complete, and then run the DISM (or Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan.

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`

![DISM Scan on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DISM-Scan-on-Windows.jpg)

## 9\. Boot into Safe Mode

 When you boot Windows into Safe Mode, it runs without any non-essential drivers and programs. This can help you verify if the issue is caused by a third-party driver or program running in the background.

 Windows 11 gives [several options for booting into Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/). You can use any of your preferred methods to enter Safe Mode and see if the Bluetooth option appears. If it does, then a third-party program or service is to blame. In that case, you’ll have to remove any recently installed apps or programs to fix the issue.

 Has the Bluetooth option disappeared on your Windows 11 computer? This can happen for several reasons, including temporary glitches, damaged Bluetooth drivers, and issues with the Windows OS. If you're unsure about what caused the problem, here are some tips that will help.

## 1\. Run the Appropriate Windows Troubleshooters

 Windows troubleshooters are built-in utilities that can help you diagnose and resolve various system-level issues. You can run the Bluetooth troubleshooter and allow Windows to fix any common Bluetooth-related issues. Here’s how:

1. Press **Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. In the **System** tab, click **Troubleshoot**.
3. Select **Other troubleshooters**.
4. Click the **Run** button next to **Bluetooth**.  
![Bluetooth Troubleshooter on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bluetooth-Troubleshooter-on-Windows-11.jpg)

 Windows will scan your computer for any issues and try to fix them. Additionally, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to scan your computer for any hardware issues. To do so:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type **msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the Open field and press **Enter**.
3. In the Hardware and Devices window, click **Next** and follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.

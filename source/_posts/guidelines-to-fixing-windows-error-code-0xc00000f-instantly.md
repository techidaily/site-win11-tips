## 1\. Reboot Your PC

 Before you dive into more complex solutions we suggest you go through a reboot first. It's one of the most tired cliches at this point, but a restart does have its merit and has been known to fix many problems on a computer or a smartphone.

 Basically, a restart clears your memory and resources, leaving you with a clean slate to start everything up. So give your PC a reboot and see if this fixes 0xc00000f.

## 2\. Run a Startup Repair

 The Startup Repair is a free, in-built Windows utility that helps you figure out and fix common Windows errors that stop you from booting up your Windows. Then, after the tool finds any bugs, it then works by getting rid of them for good.

 Here's how you can use Startup repair to fix error code 0xc00000f on your Windows PC:

2. Now boot up your PC from the installation media.
3. Select your language and then select **Repair your computer**.
4. Click on **Troubleshoot**.
5. Now, click on **Advanced options**.
6. Search for the **Startup Repair** option and select it.

 Now, follow the on-screen instructions and fix and diagnose the issues giving you the system booting error.

 That's it; the startup repair will fix any problems giving you the error code 0xc00000f and boot up your PC as usual. If it didn't do the job, there are [things to try if Startup Repair fails to fix your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-to-do-if-startup-repair-fails-to-repair-your-pc/).

 How long have you been using your computer? It's possible that there's something wrong with your computer's hardware, especially if you've been it for a while now. Indeed, losing internal components to wear and tear caused by heat, usage, etc., is very common for any computer.

 If that's the case here, it wouldn't be too surprising to encounter the 0xc00000f error code on your Windows PC. Check out our short [guide on figuring out hardware failures on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-test-your-pc-for-failing-hardware/).

 Then, depending on the results, get your PC fixed as soon as possible.

## 4\. Watch Out For Disk Errors

 A faulty disk, which itself can be caused by a variety of reasons, can almost always lead to errors like the 0xc00000f error code on your PC.

 So, if you believe that's the case here, give the CHKDSK command a go.

* Head to the Command prompt, type in _**chkdsk f: /f**_, and hit **Enter**.
* Wait till the scan gets complete.

 As soon as you're done with the above step, the Check disk utility will begin scanning and performing the fixes for your hard disk, and then solve the 0xc00000f error code from there. However, if the problem persists, head to the method below.

## 5\. Rebuild BCD

 BCD, or Boot Configuration Data in full, stores information that lets your Windows boot up easily. Briefly, it tells the boot loader where to look for critical boot information, establishes boot priority, etc., to help you start up your PC.

 Facing the 0xc00000f error code is natural, especially if something has gone wrong with your BCD. To fix your BCD settings, then, follow the steps below:

* Plug in a Windows installation media and boot up your PC from that.
* Select the **Repair Your PC** option.
* Click on **Troubleshoot > Advanced Options**.
* Select the Command prompt and run the following commands one by one and hit **Enter**:  
`bootrec /fixmbrbootrec /fixbootbootrec /scanosbootrec /rebuildbcd`

 When prompted, press **Y** to restart your PC for the changes to take effect. That's it. This will rebuild your BCD, and any problems caused by the boot menu will be resolved on time.

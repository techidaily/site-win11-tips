## Quieten the High Contrast in Windows UI

 Microsoft first introduced high-contrast themes with Windows 7\. The idea was to add a theme that helps users with low vision or photosensitivity see screen elements better. But not everyone needs the high contrast mode on Windows 11 or older versions. Maybe you turned it on by accident and are now struggling to turn it off.

 High contrast mode makes the screen elements darker to increase clarity, but the result may not look inviting for every user. As such, we will explore multiple methods to turn off the high contrast mode on Windows 11 or older operating systems.

## What Is High Contrast Mode?

 High Contrast Mode is an accessibility feature that comes free with Windows. It makes certain screen elements darker and more distinguishable so that users with low vision can see everything. High contrast mode isn’t limited to Windows only; you can also find it in Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and more.

 But there is a dark mode on Windows 11, isn't there? So, why do we need high-contrast themes? It is because dark mode can reduce the strain on the eyes and is helpful for users who don’t have problems with their vision. But dark mode makes everything black except the text and people with low vision may struggle with it.

 High contrast themes offer customizability to tweak different screen elements, like text, links, background, button text, and more. It's a lot more helpful than dark mode, which just adds a dark or black-grayish background with a white color.

## How to Disable High Contrast Mode on Windows

 If High Contrast Mode has been turned on and you'd like to change that, there are multiple ways to get the job done.

### 1\. Using the High Contrast Mode Shortcut keys

 To disable high contrast mode on Windows using keyboard shortcuts, press the**Left Alt + Left Shift + Print Screen** keys at once. You won’t see any pop-up window to confirm the action, but you will hear a “beep” sound before the system reverts to the default theme. You can use this shortcut again if you need to re-enable High Contrast mode.

### 2\. Using the Settings app

 To disable the high contrast mode using the Settings app on Windows 8 and above, do as follows.

1. Press**Win + I** to[launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) on your system.
2. Navigate to the left-hand side menu and click on**Personalization** .
3. Click on the**Themes** option under Personalization. Scroll down and click on the**Contrast Themes** option.
4. Click on the drop-down menu in the Contrast Themes option and select the**None** option.

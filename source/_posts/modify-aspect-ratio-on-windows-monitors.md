## 3\. Change Windows Display Orientation With Keyboard Shortcuts

 Another quick way to rotate your Windows computer's screen is to use keyboard shortcuts. This method can be especially useful if you frequently need to switch between different display orientations.

 Here are the keyboard shortcuts you can use to rotate your computer screen.

* **Ctrl + Alt + Right arrow:** Rotates your screen clockwise by 90 degrees (portrait-flipped).
* **Ctrl + Alt + Left arrow:** Rotates your screen counterclockwise by 90 degrees (portrait).
* **Ctrl + Alt + Down arrow:** Rotates your screen 180 degrees (landscape-flipped).
* **Ctrl + Alt + Up arrow:** Resets your screen to its original orientation (landscape).

## Regain Access to Elusive 5GHz Network on Windows 11 with These Tips

 The 2.4GHz and 5GHz are the most common Wi-Fi bands used by routers. While most computers easily recognize both these bands, some might fail to detect a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection.

 As such, if your router's 5GHz connection is not appearing on your computer, here are some fixes you can try to eliminate the problem for good.

## Why Is Windows 11 Not Showing Any 5GHz Wi-Fi Connections?

 The 5GHz band offers higher speeds and lets you connect more devices. But sometimes, Windows 11 may fail to detect the 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. This mainly happens due to the following reasons:

1. Your computer might fail to detect the 5GHz band due to driver issues.
2. The problem can appear if your router is not working correctly.
3. An issue with the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (or TCP/IP) can also be the prime reason why Windows 11 is unable to recognize the 5GHz band.

 Now that you know all the primary culprits behind the issue let's dive into the working fixes.

## 1\. Make Sure Your Computer Supports the 5GHz Wi-Fi Band

 Before getting into advanced troubleshooting, make sure your computer is compatible with the 5GHz connection. As it turns out, if your device doesn't support the 5GHz band, there's no chance it will detect it.

 To check your computer's 5GHz bandwidth compatibility, follow the below instructions:

1. Press the**Win** key to open the**Start Menu.**
2. In the search bar, type**Command Prompt** and click**Run as administrator** in the right pane.
3. Type the following command in the elevated Command Prompt window and press Enter.  
`netsh wlan show drivers`
4. Scroll down and look for the section named**"Number of** **supported bands."**  
![Check supported bands in CMD](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/check-supported-bands.jpg)
5. If this section shows both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, then it indicates your computer is compatible with the 5GHz band. But if it only shows 2.4GHz, then it means that your device doesn't support a 5GHz connection.

 Another method to confirm your computer's compatibility is by checking the radio types.

![Radio Types using Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/radio-types.jpg)

 If the radio type shows**802.11a 802.11g 802.11n** , then your computer is compatible with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz connections. But if it shows**802.11g 802.11n** or**802.11n 802.11g 802.11b** as available network modes, then your device only supports the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band.

## 2\. Restart Your Router

 Your computer might fail to detect the 5GHz connection if there's something wrong with your router. Restarting the router is one of the best ways you can try to get rid of most of the network issues, including this one. Hence, check out our guide on[how to restart your router](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-router/) and check if it makes any difference.

## 3\. Manually Enable the 5GHz Wi-Fi Band

 Windows lets you manually enable or disable the 5GHz Wi-Fi band on your computer. You can do it with the help of the Device Manager. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Press the**Win + X** hotkeys to open the**Power menu,** and choose**Device Manager** from the list.
2. Expand the**Network adapters,** right-click on the installed Network adapter, and choose**Properties** from the context menu.
3. In the Properties window, click the**Advanced** tab.
4. Select the**5G Wireless Mode** and click the drop-down icon under**Value.**
5. Choose**IEEE 802.11a/n** from the list.  
![Enable 5GHz in Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/enable-5ghz.jpg)
6. Click**OK** to save the changes.

## 4\. Disable and Re-Enable the Wi-Fi Adapter

 A Wi-Fi adapter is an important component that lets your device connect to a network. Sometimes, a temporary glitch with the Wi-Fi adapter can stop Windows from recognizing a particular band.

 The solution, in this case, is to disable and then re-enable the Wi-Fi adapter. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Run dialog box by pressing the**Win + R** hotkeys.
2. In the search bar, type**control,** and press**Enter** . This is one of many[ways to open the Control Panel on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-control-panel/) .
3. In the Control Panel, head towards**Network and Internet** \>**Network and Sharing Center** .
4. Click**Change adapter settings** in the left panel.
5. Right-click on the Wi-Fi adapter and click**Disable.**  
![Disable Network Adapter using Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/disable-network-adapter.jpg)
6. Wait for a minute or so, and then right-click on the Wi-Fi adapter again and choose**Enable.**

 That's it. Now check if your computer is showing a 5GHz connection.

## 5\. Run the Internet Connection Troubleshooter

[Windows 11 comes with various troubleshooters](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/) that you can use to get rid of most of the system-level problems. If the problem results from an issue with your network adapter, you can run the Internet Connection troubleshooter. Here's how:

1. Open the**Settings menu** by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. In the Settings menu, click the**System** option in the left panel.
3. Head towards**Troubleshoot** \>**Other troubleshooters** .
4. Click the**Run** button next to**Internet Connection** .  
![Internet Connection Troubleshooter in the Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/internet-connection-troubleshooter.jpg)

 The troubleshooter will scan your network adapter for issues. If it finds any, follow the on-screen instructions to apply the recommended fixes.

## 6\. Download the Latest Network Driver Update

 You will likely face the issue if you last updated the network driver a long time ago. To download the latest network driver update on your computer, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Device Manager, expand the Network adapter, right-click on the installed network adapter and choose**Update** **driver** .
2. Select**Search automatically for drivers** from the window that crops up.

## 7\. Reset TCP/IP and Flush DNS Cache

 The next solution on the list is to reset the TCP/IP and then flush the DNS cache. Here's how:

1. Open Command Prompt with admin rights.
2. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type the following commands and press Enter after each one:  
`netsh winsock reset  
netsh int ip reset  
ipconfig /release  
ipconfig /flushdns  
ipconfig /renew`

Reboot your computer after executing the above commands.

## Get Faster Transfer Speeds With a 5GHz Connection

 Nothing more frustrating than settling for 2.4GHz if you know your computer is compatible with the 5GHz connection. The problem mainly results due to corruption in the network adapter. Fortunately, you can quickly fix the issue by following the solutions.

 But in the worst-case scenario, if the problem continues, you can consider resetting your network settings.

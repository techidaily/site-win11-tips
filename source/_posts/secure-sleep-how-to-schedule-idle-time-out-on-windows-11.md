 To create a shutdown task:

1. Press the **Win** key to open the **Windows search** bar.
2. Type **Task scheduler** and click on the app from the search result to open it.

## How to Stop an Automatic Shutdown via Task Scheduler

![disable active tasks task scheduler](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/disable-active-tasks-task-scheduler.png)

 To stop automatic Windows shutdown, you'll need to delete or [disable the scheduled task in Windows Task Scheduler](https://www.makeuseof.com/disable-scheduled-tasks-windows-10/).

## How to Schedule a Windows 11 Shutdown Using Command Prompt or PowerShell

 Task Scheduler is an excellent utility but may feel a little complicated for those who don’t use it often. Maybe you want to make your computer turn off after inactivity, but occasionally. In this instance, creating a scheduled task is unnecessary and tedious.

 If you don’t want to go through the learning curve, you can use the **shutdown** command in Command Prompt. The shutdown command lets you set a shutdown timer to power off and restart your Windows computer automatically.

 To schedule a system shutdown using Command Prompt:

1. Press the **Win + X** to open the **WinX menu.**  
![automated shut down windows 11 command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/automated-shut-down-windows-11-command-prompt.png)
2. Click on **Windows Terminal (Admin)** to open the elevated terminal.
3. In the Windows Terminal window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Shutdown /s -t Nseconds`
4. In the above command, replace **Nseconds** with the number of seconds. For example, if you want to set a timer for 5 minutes (300 seconds), then the complete command will look like this:  
`Shutdown /s -t 300`
5. The above command will trigger the Windows logoff action and shutdown your PC after 5 minutes.
6. If you want to perform a scheduled restart, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Shutdown -r -t Nseconds`
7. In the above command, replace **Nseconds** with the number of seconds to set a timer for a restart.  
![automated shut down windows 11 command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/automated-shut-down-windows-11-command-prompt.png)
8. If you want to define a specific shutdown time instead, use the **at time shutdown /s** command. For example, to schedule a shutdown at 12:30 AM, use the following command:  
`at 00:30 shutdown /s`
9. To cancel the shutdown or restart the timer, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Shutdown -a`

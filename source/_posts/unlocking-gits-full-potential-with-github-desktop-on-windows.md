## Unlocking Git's Full Potential with GitHub Desktop on Windows

 Git and GitHub are essential tools for developers. However, the learning curve to adapting git version control into your daily workflow can be difficult at first. Newbie developers are often frustrated by the extensive list of commands needed to use git.

 Fortunately, GitHub Desktop allows you to work with git through an interactive user interface that does not require any commands. Read on as we describe what GitHub Desktop is and how to make the most of it on a Windows PC.

## What Is GitHub Desktop?

 GitHub Desktop is an intuitive desktop application that allows users to work with Git without the hassle of the command line. GitHub Desktop is an open-source tool (meaning it’s free to use) that relies on the efforts of the developer community to simplify workflow for developers and improve team collaboration.

 If you don’t enjoy using Git via the command line, you’ll find GitHub Desktop to be a valuable tool that makes your life easy. Quite obviously, GitHub Desktop is not as powerful as using [git from the command line](https://www.makeuseof.com/advanced-git-tutorial/) , but it can still help you accomplish a lot.

 You can clone remote repositories, make commits, work on multiple branches, and even push code through GitHub Desktop without writing a single git command.

 Once you’ve set up GitHub Desktop with a repository, you can also create issues and pull requests. You can even review pull requests your team makes directly within GitHub Desktop.

 All in all, GitHub Desktop helps you adapt the best practices for git through an easy-to-use interface allowing you to take version control of your projects to the next level.

1. Launch the GitHub Desktop app from the**Start** menu.
2. Select the**Current repository** dropdown and choose the project you want to work on.

4. Enter a name for the branch and select**Create branch** to confirm your selection.
5. To move your current working changes to the new branch, select the**Bring my changes to** button.

 Similarly, if you want to switch to a different branch, select the**Current branch** dropdown and select the branch name you want to change to.

### How to Commit Using GitHub Desktop on Windows

 Now that you’ve learned how to set up your project and create branches in GitHub Desktop let’s look at how you can commit code into your branch.

1. Open the cloned GitHub repo in your preferred code editor.
2. From GitHub Desktop, switch to the branch you want to work in (you can use the steps described in the previous section).
3. Make the necessary changes in your code and save the files.

6. Select the**Commit to** button to confirm your changes and commit code into your branch.

### How to Push Code Using GitHub Desktop on Windows

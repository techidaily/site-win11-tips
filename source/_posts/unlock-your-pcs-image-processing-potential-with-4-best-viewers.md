## Unlock Your PC's Image Processing Potential with 4 Best Viewers

 The default Photos app on Windows does not support WebP images. Therefore, Windows users need to convert these images to other formats or view them directly in browsers that support them. In addition, we can't edit them in their original format since we can't open them.

 The best solution to this problem is to install an application that supports WebP format. In this article, we'll look at the four best WebP image viewers you can download on your Windows devices. We will also demonstrate how to open and edit images using them.

 PhotoScape X is a lightweight image viewer and editor that supports WebP images. The app is available on Microsoft Store, so it's safe to use, and being free is an extra bonus.

 It allows you to keep the previewed or edited images in WebP format or convert them to a format of your choice. Thus, the tool not only helps you view WebP images but also converts them.

1. Get PhotoScape X from the[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/photoscape-x/9NBLGGH4TWWG) .
2. Launch the app once it has been installed.
3. Drag and drop the image you want to view into the app. Alternatively, you can click on the**Open** option and select the image you wish to view.

## 3\. Snagit

 With its amazing interface and ease of use, Snagit is one of the highly recommended[image editors for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-photo-editing-software/) . Fortunately, it supports the WebP format. You can view WebP images in this app and edit them using its helpful features.

 When you first download and install Snagit, you'll find two apps with slightly different names on your computer: Snagit and Snagit Editor. You can open and edit WebP images using Snagit Editor. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to the[TechSmith website](https://www.techsmith.com/download/snagit/) to download and install Snagit.
2. Open the Snagit Editor app by searching for**"Snagit Editor"** in Windows Search.

6. Choose a format from**Save as type** dropdown menu and click**Save** .

 The downside of Snagit is that you will be required to purchase a subscription after the 15-day trial. The investment, however, is well worth it. In addition, note that Snagit is a third-party app, not available on the Microsoft Store, so make sure to read its privacy policies. This way, you will ensure that the app is not collecting data you do not want.

**Download:** [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/download/snagit/) (Subscription required, free trial available)

## 4\. qView

 qView is another minimalistic image viewer that supports WebP images. Besides being free to download, it has a small size and low resource consumption, so it will not overload your system. With this app, you can check image information such as file size, modified date, etc. Moreover, you can directly import the opened images into any app of your choice.

 The downside of qView is that you cannot edit WebP images, unlike other image viewers on this list. However, if you're looking for a lightweight tool to only view WebP images, qView will be a good choice. To view WebP images in qView, follow these steps:

1. Visit the[InterverseHQ website](https://interversehq.com/qview/download/) to download qView.
2. Install the app and launch it after it has been downloaded.
3. At first, you'll see a black screen, so don't panic.
4. Right-click the app interface and click**Open** .

5. Select the file that you want to open.
6. To import the image into another editor, right-click the image, choose**Open With** from the options, and select the app of your choice.  
![Clicking on Open With to Export the Opened Image From qView to Paint App on Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/14-clicking-on-open-with-to-export-the-opened-image-from-qview-to-paint-app-on-window.jpg)

 qView is not available on the Microsoft Store either, just like Snagit. Therefore, the same rules apply here as well.

**Download:** [qView](https://interversehq.com/qview/download/) (Free)

## View and Edit WebP Images on Windows

 There is no direct way to open WebP images on Windows, so the best way is to use an application that supports this format. We have compiled a list of the best WebP image viewers to help you easily open and edit WebP images. While you can use any tool you like most, we recommend Snagit. PhotoScape X is a good choice for those who prefer freeware.

 If you get tired of these image viewers, you can also set your browser not to save images in WebP format. This way, you can save, edit, and use them in the format of your choice.
